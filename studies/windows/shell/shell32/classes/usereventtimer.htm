<h1>UserEventTimer </h1>
<p>Windows provides standard API functions for tracking the passing of time, with 
notifications issued on expiry of a timeout. However, this functionality measures 
time by the clock, without regard to whether the user was in any sense active. It 
is sometimes desirable that idle time, free of user input, should not count as time 
passed. SHELL32 provides just this facility, going by the name of User Event Timers, 
through an essentially undocumented COM class. Instances can be created using such 
well-documented COM functions as <span class="function">CoCreateInstance</span>, 
by anyone who knows the CLSID: </p>
<table>
  <tr>
    <td><span class="constant">CLSID_UserEventTimer</span> </td>
    <td><span class="clsid">{864A1288-354C-4D19-9D68-C2742BB12997}</span> </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>The class implements the <span class="interface">
<a href="../interfaces/iusereventtimer/index.htm">IUserEventTimer</a></span> interface, 
with support from an <span class="interface">
<a href="../interfaces/iusereventtimercallback/index.htm">IUserEventTimerCallback</a></span> 
interface. </p>
<h2>Implementation </h2>
<p>For each <span class="class">UserEventTimer</span> object, SHELL32 creates a 
window with the class name “UserEventWindow”. Once created, this window exists only 
to handle <span class="message">WM_TIMER</span> messages. To receive such messages, 
the window sets at most one timer, in the sense of the standard Windows API function
<span class="function">SetTimer</span>. This timer is here called the
<span class="definition">internal</span> timer. It is set to trigger periodically, 
making for a sequence of ticks. At each tick, the internal timer checks whether 
there was user input since the tick before. If there was not, then the interval 
between ticks is treated as idle time and is disregarded. </p>
<p>Through the <span class="interface">IUserEventTimer</span> interface, users of 
a <span class="class">UserEventTimer</span> object set any number of user event 
timers, each with their own timeout period and their own directions for notification 
of the timeout’s expiry. The internal timer is set only while at least one user 
event timer is set. At each tick when the internal timer detects that there has 
been user input since the previous tick, the interval between ticks is counted against 
the time remaining for each user event timer. Where a deduction causes a user event 
timer to expire, that timer’s notification is triggered and its timeout is restored 
for counting down again. </p>
<h2>Availability </h2>
<p>The <span class="class">UserEventTimer</span> class is implemented in SHELL32.DLL 
version 6.00 and higher. </p>
<p>Though the object and the related interfaces seem never to have been documented, 
they are declared in the SHOBJIDL.IDL (and thus also SHOBJIDL.H) from the Platform 
SDK dated February 2003. Those declarations may have been an oversight: they are 
removed from the Windows Vista SDK dated January 2007. </p>
