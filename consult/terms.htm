  <h1>Consultation Terms </h1>
  <p>If you consult Geoff Chappell, you will in fact be consulting Geoff Chappell 
  Ltd, which is incorporated in New York State. Unless otherwise agreed, all billable 
  work will be done by Geoff Chappell specifically, who speaks here for the company 
  as its President. </p>
  <p>These terms (and my <a href="fees.htm">fees</a>) are negotiable if you make 
  at least some attempt at accommodating the guidelines that I present here. The 
  attempt need be nothing more than explaining your needs so that I can understand. 
  Note the converse: I can’t accommodate what you don’t explain. </p>
  <p>That I make a point of explicitly stating terms is, of course, a defensiveness 
  born of bad experience. I hope to please just from getting stuck straight into 
  working at the things that you need and which I can do for you. </p>
  <h2>Confidentiality </h2>
  <p>I happily agree to non-disclosure of anything that I learn about your software 
  and methods. I anyway take my clients’ confidentiality as understood. </p>
  <h2>Intellectual Property </h2>
  <p>I also happily agree that any software or reports that I write for you are 
  works for hire in terms of copyright. For software, however, your bill will be 
  lower and my enthusiasm about working for you will be greater if you allow me 
  to use my own headers and libraries without risking that you claim ownership of 
  them or deny me the continued reuse of them. </p>
  <p>If in the course of working on your software I invent something such that you 
  can patent, then it’s entirely yours: I renounce all interest. </p>
  <h3>Research </h3>
  <p>Recognise, please, that very little software stands in isolation. That you 
  think to consult me very likely means that you at least perceive some trouble 
  between your software and some other software, notably Windows. Anything that 
  I learn about other software while working on your software’s interaction with 
  it must be my professional development, not your intellectual property (as much 
  as it can be anyone’s). </p>
  <p>Engage me for research, if you want, and then whatever I uncover for you is 
  entirely yours, but what I ordinarily sell is the <span class="emphasis">application</span> 
  of research to your problem, not the research itself. Unless you are specifically 
  commissioning research into Windows, then any attempt by you to claim ownership 
  of discoveries and know-how about Windows—or even to restrict my future development 
  of such discoveries and know-how should I have become aware of them while working 
  on your problem—means at best that I can’t risk applying any such knowledge to 
  your problem for your benefit. I can instead be no more than a capable programmer, 
  bringing to your work my substantial experience with Windows programming but applying 
  only what is public knowledge. Why would you want to cripple the work I can do 
  for you? </p>
  <p>An example may help. If while I work on your software I notice a defect in 
  Windows, then my professional duty to you for what you pay me is discharged by 
  saving your software from falling to the defect. Whether I then make a detailed 
  study of the defect on my own time at my own cost, and write it up for publication 
  is my business. Deny or frustrate that business if you must, but do not expect 
  that my published fees account for it. If your needs for intellectual property 
  require that you claim even discoveries that merely pertain to the work I do for 
  you, as you might reasonably for work done by an employee, then be honest about 
  the processes: make an offer of full-time employment or pay full freight for the 
  research. </p>
  <h2>Invoicing and Payment </h2>
  <p>Payment is due 14 days from invoicing. Payment is to be made by direct deposit 
  into a bank account that will be specified on the invoice. Payments from outside 
  the U.S. are to be transferred telegraphically in U.S. dollars at the sender’s 
  expense. I may require part-payment in advance of starting any work that is expected 
  to take more than a week. I may require periodic part-payment during large projects, 
  i.e., that are expected to take several weeks. </p>
  <p>You do not own the work until you pay for it. </p>
  <p>I must dismiss you as completely unreasonable if you even hint that I should 
  work intensively to your benefit for weeks but have to wait months before you 
  pay me: have a sense of proportion, please! </p>
  <h2>Business Premises </h2>
  <p>Only exceptionally will I work on-site for you or agree to any terms that seem 
  motivated by your expecting that the work will be done on-site. </p>
  <p>I appreciate that you may be concerned for the security of products in development 
  or of data streams that contain sensitive information. I will try to accommodate 
  your reasonable concerns. I appreciate that collaborative opportunities, informal 
  teaching and many other things of potential but somewhat intangible benefit to 
  you—and to me—truly can develop only from on-site interaction.</p>
  <p>However, experience shows that even businesses that pride themselves on their 
  support for so-called knowledge workers sometimes provide absolutely wretched 
  places for intellectual work, at least of the sort that benefits from, if not 
  requires, long periods of intense concentration. I don’t have time, at any price, 
  for indulging anyone’s apparent tolerance for sloppy work, which is inevitably 
  what you tolerate when you can’t or won’t provide a suitable workplace. </p>
  <p>That you think to consult me very likely means that your work has become unusually 
  intricate in some way and will only be attended to properly by concentrating on 
  it, possibly for hours on end. I am not interested in a bigger bill for working 
  additional hours in frustration. My aim is to do the most thorough work in the 
  least time for the lowest cost. If your workplace does not provide for working 
  in peace, then do not even think to ask me to work on-site at any price (but perhaps 
  do think to rescue your current workers). </p>
  <h2>Written Contracts </h2>
  <p>Please be sure that any contract you ask me to sign is appropriate for occasional 
  consultation of an external resource with independent interests in intellectual 
  property. Except for confidentiality or some warranty against unreasonable defects 
  in my work, I will accept no obligation to you that persists between consultations 
  or continues after. Your legal department perhaps already has a model for its 
  own occasional need for outside counsel. Your engineering department perhaps has 
  a different model that it agrees to for occasional support by software manufacturers.
  </p>
  <p>If you instead try to tie me up with procedures and requirements whose direct 
  connection with doing the work is nothing you can explain, then I am less likely 
  to be available to you and certainly not for my published fees. </p>
  <p>If you require me to agree to your standard terms, then please review them 
  before sending them to me (or directing me to your website where you already publish 
  them). Ensure that any overheads you would impose on me are meaningful, productive 
  and even essential. Don’t insist that I jump through hoops for reasons that you 
  can’t or won’t explain. You will get a lower bill from me, as a consequence of 
  more energetic, enthusiastic and concentrated effort on your behalf, if you let 
  me get stuck into the work that I specialise in. The work, not my indulgence of 
  your overheads, is what you’d be consulting me for, isn’t it? </p>
