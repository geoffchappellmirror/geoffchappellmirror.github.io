  <h1>New in October 2010 </h1>
  <p>Just when I had resigned myself to the notion that the computer security industry 
  doesn’t care to invest in reverse engineering, along comes the Stuxnet worm and 
  numerous investigations in which investment by each of any number of security 
  companies is apparently to be measured in man-months. Of course, reports that 
  have taken man-months would want to be detailed, and though I’m not shaken in 
  my belief that competition in reverse engineering, as practised by the computer 
  security industry, is less about the quality of the work than the unsupported 
  use of terms such as “in-depth” and “comprehensive”, I must admit that a quick 
  look at Stuxnet confirmed that most of it surely had been mined at least well 
  enough that I would not find much to add except by committing to a full study. 
  I can’t now catch up on others’ man-months, but within the constraints of what 
  I will do for free, I did find one perspective that seemed novel enough to justify 
  spending a little time to write up most of what I know about one Stuxnet component: 
  one of the kernel-mode drivers looks to have been written independently of everything 
  else in Stuxnet, as a general loader of almost arbitrary user-mode malware.
  </p>
  <p>Before moving on, it occurred to me that although everyone surely has realised 
  that to talk of Stuxnet exploiting a vulnerability in .LNK files is to shoot the 
  messenger, someone ought to note it explicitly. Indeed, the coding oversight that’s 
  depended on isn’t any sort of parsing error in .LNK files, as Microsoft and some 
  supposed experts would have you believe, but is instead that the Control Panel 
  is not nearly defensive enough about what it executes. Shortcut files just present 
  the best <span class="emphasis">vector</span> for exploiting the vulnerability. 
  You may think this is nit-picking, but if defect and vector are not differentiated, 
  the defect may not be properly fixed and other vectors may go unexamined. </p>
  <p>I’m biased, unsurprisingly, but I think a substantial opportunity was missed 
  by not having me on hand to have got started on Stuxnet in June or July. Look 
  around my other write-ups on malware. If you agree with me that I bring a new 
  level of detail to such studies and you have a budget, then make me an offer for 
  my services. After all, if you’re going to commit man-months to reverse-engineering 
  some malware, don’t you want it done by the best you can get? It may even turn 
  out that you don’t need as many man-months to do the same as your competitors, 
  and you stand to find things out that they don’t. </p>
