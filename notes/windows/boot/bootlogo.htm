  <h1>Install a Boot Logo for Windows XP </h1>
  <p>The Windows XP kernel ordinarily displays a logo and progress bar while booting. 
  There exists a small industry—yes, with software actually for sale—concerned with 
  changing this boot logo. Moreover, this personalisation is apparently so desirable 
  that people are prepared to get it by editing the bitmap resources in the kernel, 
  even to the point of working around particular locations within Microsoft’s images.
  </p>
  <p>As it happens, nothing even nearly so drastic is needed for changing the boot 
  logo in Windows XP. A simple reconfiguration that disables the ordinary boot logo 
  is well-known from Microsoft’s documentation. Microsoft also provides, but seems 
  not to document, a similarly simple reconfiguration for displaying an installable 
  boot logo instead. </p>
  <h2>Directions </h2>
  <p>Prepare your boot logo as a file in the Windows Bitmap (BMP) format. It must 
  be displayable using VGA graphics. This means specifically that the image can 
  be no larger than 640 by 480 pixels and that the palette can have no more than 
  (any) 16 colours. <a target="_top" href="_download/boot.bmp">Download an example</a>.
  </p>
  <p>Save your logo file as BOOT.BMP in the Windows directory (typically C:\WINDOWS) 
  of whichever Windows XP installation you want this boot logo to apply to. </p>
  <p>In the <span class="inisect">[operating systems]</span> section of your BOOT.INI 
  file, find an entry that corresponds to that same Windows installation. To this 
  entry (or perhaps to a copy of it, for safety, at least at the first attempt), 
  add the options <span class="switch">/bootlogo /noguiboot</span>. </p>
  <h3>Explanation </h3>
  <p>The (undocumented) <span class="switch">/bootlogo</span> option tells the NTLDR 
  to display the installable boot logo. The (documented) <span class="switch">/noguidboot</span> 
  option tells the NT kernel not to show the ordinary logo from the kernel’s resources—and, 
  in combination with <span class="switch">/bootlogo</span>, to leave alone whatever 
  already is displayed. </p>
  <h3>Warning </h3>
  <p>Be sure not to stray from VGA compatibility. The NTLDR does not check at all 
  that the file conforms to one of the few suitable formats. The best consequence 
  of installing an unsuitable BOOT.BMP is that the image is displayed unrecognisably. 
  One case is known that is more serious: if the image has 4 bits per pixel and 
  the bitmap data is not stored with the BMP format’s Run Length Encoding (RLE) 
  compression, then if the image width exceeds 640 pixels, a programming error may 
  cause the NTLDR to crash while trying to display the logo. </p>
  <p>(The coding error is a buffer overflow. The 4 bits-per-pixel format for uncompressed 
  bitmap data in the file does not correspond directly to what must be written to 
  the 4 colour planes of video memory. For each colour plane in each whole row of 
  the video image, the code extracts the video bits from the file data to an 80-byte 
  buffer on the stack. This size suffices if the image width is no greater than 
  640 pixels, but none of the relevant code ever checks, and a wider image therefore 
  corrupts some amount of whatever follows the buffer on the stack.) </p>
  <h2>Applicability </h2>
  <p>This note is based on inspection of the NTLDR file from Windows XP Service 
  Pack 1. However, perusal of other Windows versions for a revision of this article 
  in 2007 has shown that the feature dates from at least the original Windows XP 
  and continues at least until Windows Server 2003 Service Pack 1. </p>
  <h3>Windows Vista </h3>
  <p>In the reworking of the boot-time executables in Windows Vista, the boot option 
  that BCDEDIT presents as <span class="bcdopt">quietboot</span> translates for 
  all practical purposes to the combination of <span class="switch">/bootlogo</span> 
  and <span class="switch">/noguiboot</span> (notwithstanding that Microsoft continues 
  to document only the latter). However, the boot logo is no longer found so simply. 
  It is still taken from a named file (see below for details), but the location 
  is not so readily accessible, being a WIM file stored within WINLOAD.EXE as a 
  data resource. A WIM file is a disk image, and the files within the file are easily 
  enough worked with, e.g., to be replaced by a bitmap of your own, given the right 
  tools. However, these tools are not supplied as standard with Windows, and there 
  is anyway the complication that WINLOAD.EXE is a signed executable. </p>
  <p>The bitmap file for the installable boot logo in Windows Vista must be named 
  either “osload1024x768.bmp” or “osload800x600.bmp”, depending on the display resolution, 
  and be in the root directory of the disk image. It is now allowed 1, 24 or 32 
  bits per pixel, and RLE compression is no longer supported. </p>
