<h1>GetShellSecurityDescriptor </h1>
<p>This function prepares a security descriptor. </p>
<h2>Declaration </h2>
<pre class="source">PSECURITY_DESCRIPTOR
GetShellSecurityDescriptor (
    PSHELL_USER_PERMISSION apUserPerm,
    int cUserPerm);</pre>
<h3>Parameters </h3>
<p>The <span class="argument">apUserPerm</span> argument provides the address of 
an array of <span class="struct">SHELL_USER_PERMISSION</span> structures, each 
of which describes permissions to apply to some user or group. </p>
<p>The <span class="argument">cUserPerm</span> argument provides a count of
<span class="struct">SHELL_USER_PERMISSION</span> structures in the array. </p>
<h3>Structures </h3>
<p>Since the <span class="struct">SHELL_USER_PERMISSION</span> structure appears 
to be used only as input to this function, its format is as well given here with 
the parameters. </p>
<pre class="source">typedef struct _SHELL_USER_PERMISSION {
    SHELL_USER_SID susID;
    DWORD dwAccessType;
    BOOL fInherit;
    ACCESS_MASK dwAccessMask;
    DWORD dwInheritMask;
    ACCESS_MASK dwInheritAccessMask;
} SHELL_USER_PERMISSION, *PSHELL_USER_PERMISSION;</pre>
<p>The user or group is described by the <span class="member">susID</span> 
member. It has the format of a <span class="struct">SHELL_USER_SID</span> 
structure and provides sufficient information from which to build a <span class="struct">
SID</span>. The successive members provide the identifier authority and two 
subauthorities, or only one if the second is zero. If the authority is <span class="constant">
SECURITY_NULL_SID_AUTHORITY</span> 
and the two subauthorities are each zero (<span class="constant">SECURITY_NULL_RID</span>), 
then the <span class="member">susID</span> member is understood to describe the 
current user. </p>
<pre class="source">typedef struct _SHELL_USER_SID {
    SID_IDENTIFIER_AUTHORITY sidAuthority;
    DWORD dwUserGroupID;
    DWORD dwUserID;
} SHELL_USER_SID, *PSHELL_USER_SID;</pre>
<p>The <span class="member">dwAccessType</span> member is zero (<span class="constant">ACCESS_ALLOWED_ACE_TYPE</span>) 
to allow access, else non-zero to deny access. The <span class="member">
dwAccessMask</span> 
member provides the access rights that are to be allowed or denied. </p>
<p>The <span class="member">fInherit</span> member is non-zero if access is to 
be inheritable. In this case, the <span class="member">dwInheritMask</span> 
member provides flags that govern the inheritance (as in the <span class="member">
AceFlags</span> 
member of an <span class="struct">ACE</span>) and the <span class="member">
dwInheritAccessMask</span> 
member provides the access rights that are to be transferred when inheriting.
</p>
<h3>Return Value </h3>
<p>The function returns the address of a security descriptor, if successful, 
else NULL. </p>
<h2>Behaviour </h2>
<p>The function fails immediately if <span class="argument">pUserPerm</span> is 
NULL or if <span class="argument">cUserPerm</span> is not positive. </p>
<p>For each <span class="struct">SHELL_USER_PERMISSION</span> structure, the 
function prepares either one <span class="struct">ACE</span> or two for the 
security descriptor, depending on whether the permissions are inheritable. The 
first
<span class="struct">ACE</span> </p>
<ul>
  <li>applies to the user or group described by <span class="member">susID</span>;
  </li>
  <li>is access-allowed or access-denied depending on <span class="member">
  dwAccessType</span>;
  </li>
  <li>has no inheritance (or other <span class="member">AceFlags</span>); </li>
  <li>takes its access rights from <span class="member">dwAccessMask</span>;
  </li>
</ul>
<p>A second <span class="struct">ACE</span> for this same <span class="struct">
SHELL_USER_PERMISSION</span> 
is prepared if and only if <span class="member">fInherit</span> is non-zero. 
This second <span class="struct">ACE</span> </p>
<ul>
  <li>applies, like the first, to the user or group described by
  <span class="member">susID</span>; </li>
  <li>is, like the first, access-allowed or access-denied depending on
  <span class="member">dwAccessType</span>; </li>
  <li>has inheritance flags (and other <span class="member">AceFlags</span>) set 
  from <span class="member">dwInheritMask</span>; </li>
  <li>takes its access rights from <span class="member">dwInheritAccessMask</span>.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>The <span class="struct">SID</span> for each <span class="struct">ACE</span> 
is built from the authority and subauthorities provided by <span class="member">
susID</span>, except that if <span class="member">susID</span> describes the 
current user, the function obtains a <span class="struct">SID</span> from the 
access token for the current process. </p>
<p>The security descriptor is constructed in one memory block such that the
<span class="struct">SECURITY_DESCRIPTOR</span> structure (in absolute format) 
is followed immediately by an <span class="struct">ACL</span>, including the
<span class="struct">ACE</span>s. This <span class="struct">ACL</span> is set as 
the security descriptor’s DACL. The order of the <span class="struct">ACE</span>s 
is the same as the <span class="struct">SHELL_USER_PERMISSION</span> structures 
that they were built from. The memory block is obtained from
<span class="function">LocalAlloc</span> and may be returned through
<span class="function">LocalFree</span> when the caller is done with it. </p>
<h2>Availability </h2>
<p>The <span class="function">GetShellSecurityDescriptor</span> function is 
exported from SHLWAPI as ordinal 475 in version 5.50 and higher. </p>

<p>Though this function dates from as long ago as 2000, it was still not 
documented by Microsoft in the MSDN Library at least as late as the CD edition 
dated January 2004. </p>

<!--webbot bot="Include" i-checksum="41429" endspan -->
<p>This function has, however, got documented since then (in 2006, or perhaps 
some time during 2005), albeit as requiring “version 6.0 or later”. This article 
now uses Microsoft’s nomenclature. </p>
