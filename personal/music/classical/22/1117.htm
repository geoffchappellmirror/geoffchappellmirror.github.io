  <h1>Of Earth, Sea, and Sky </h1>
  <div class="Abstract">
    <p>Concert by the New York Philharmonic on 17th November 2022, with Hannu Lintu 
    (conductor), Sergei Babayan and Daniil Trifanov (pianists) as guests, performing 
    works by Stravinsky, Bartók, Saariaho and Sibelius </p>
  </div>
  <p>Who comes up with these titles? And why? This one is of the first concert I’ve 
  chosen by the New York Philharmonic for the 2022-2023 season. I chose it for the 
  Bartók and loved it for the Sibelius, but I am not nearly poetic enough to sense 
  where earth, sea and sky come into it. </p>
  <p>That the Bartók was on the programme meant that there never was any real chance 
  that I would not have chosen this concert. Perhaps if they had filled the rest 
  of the programme with Mozart or similar, I might have put it aside with regret. 
  But this particular Bartók is an adaptation of a lesser piece that I much admire 
  from the one recording I have of it, sort of, and although Bartók is often on 
  programmes here in New York—he lived here for his last few years—I could not sensibly 
  expect that I would ever see this particular piece in live performance if I passed 
  on it now. Anyway, the programme was entirely of 20th-century music. </p>
  <p>There had been a programme change. I don’t recall that this has ever happened 
  to me, yet I’ve already been notified of this and another for the season. The 
  logistics are surely complicated not just for being the first post-pandemic season 
  back at Lincoln Center but the first since the extensive renovation of the concert 
  hall (now named David Geffen Hall, though I still keep thinking of it as Avery 
  Fisher Hall). It’s also the first season for which I’ve bought my tickets online—but 
  that this has got me slightly less good seating than I have been used to is another 
  story. </p>
  <p>Instead of the originally programmed <span class="title">Oceanides</span> by 
  Sibelius, the orchestra opened with Stravinsky’s <span class="title">Symphonies 
  of Wind Instruments</span> . This was composed in 1920 but this performance was 
  of its (substantial) revision from 1947. I never have cared much for Stravinsky, 
  though this might better be understood relatively, given that I have pretty much 
  the complete bundle of his recordings as conductor. On that set this piece is 
  unfortunately in mono from 1951 but I’ve listened to it more often than some others 
  since it happens to follow the <span class="title">Ebony Concerto</span> which 
  is a piece I often reach for when I have only ten minutes to fill (and this recording 
  has the attraction of having Benny Goodman as soloist). To hear the
  <span class="title">Symphonies of Wind Instruments</span> in live performance 
  brought new interest. I may just be imagining this but it seemed to me that the 
  hall’s acoustics—which I am surely not alone in thinking used to be less than 
  helpful—have improved such that I could easily pick out the instruments and admire 
  the skill with which Stravinsky develops his changing colours. </p>
  <p>The Bartók that I came for has long been known to me as the
  <span class="title">Sonata for Two Pianos and Percussion</span>. It was composed 
  in 1937 but transcribed in 1940 as the <span class="title">Concerto for Two Pianos 
  and Orchestra</span>, apparently at the urging of the publisher who not unreasonably 
  thought it might increase the likelihood of performance. In neither form does 
  it get anything like the attention it deserves. Bartók was himself a pianist of 
  no small distinction and as attested by his piano concertos he wrote with a strong 
  sense of the piano as a percussion instrument. That he wrote superbly for percussion 
  is well attested by the much loved (and much more frequently performed)
  <span class="title">Music for Strings, Percussion and Celesta</span> from 1936. 
  I know of the Sonata only from a CD that I listen to at least a few times each 
  year, and now I have heard the Concerto only once but live. Each has its merits, 
  of course, but I found that although the orchestra added tone and colour, it too 
  often distracted from and even obscured the pinpoint clarity of the percussion 
  and pianos. I might have preferred these performers doing the Sonata but I’ve 
  surely heard the Concerto at its best. From pianists of the calibre of Daniil 
  Trifanov and Sergei Babayan, you get the luxury that clarity and precision are 
  never in doubt. The three principal percussionists—the orchestra’s own—were similarly 
  expert. The intricate synchronisation with two pianos was a treat to hear. </p>
  <p>The two pieces performed after the intermission were both from Finland. The 
  first, by Kaija Saariaho and only 10 minutes long, was extracted in 2003 from 
  a larger orchestral work composed in 2002. As these things go, this is very new 
  music. It’s programmed to the Greek mythology of <span class="title">Orion</span>, 
  the extracted middle portion being named <span class="title">Ciel d’hiver</span>, 
  apparently being concerned with Orion’s appearance as a constellation in the winter 
  wky. No matter. The music was interesting in and of itself as a tone poem but 
  less for whatever might be the poem than for the tone. This composer explores 
  the ranges and blending of instruments, and if I add the shaping of colour then 
  perhaps I am more influenced by the poetic than I like to think. I want to hear 
  this again, in part because I don’t know what I might make of it long-term.
  </p>
  <p>A growing sense that the evening’s experience of carefully graded transitions 
  in sound had much to do with the conductor—Hannu Lintu, from Finland, surely not 
  coincidentally—was confirmed beyond doubt by the performance of
  <span class="title">Symphony No. 7</span> by Sibelius. I’d be surprised if this 
  is anyone’s favourite symphony by Sibelius. I’ve always found it a pleasant coda 
  to the other six, a joy to listen to but without demanding and sustaining my interest 
  as do the fourth, fifth and sixth. I’d have said I know the seventh moderately 
  well but now I realise I don’t know it nearly well enough. No, that’s not quite 
  correct: I’ve always known but now I realise I must do something about it. The 
  problem for me with this relatively short symphony—it’s barely 20 minutes—is that 
  it presents all its material up front. The fault is instead with me for not paying 
  attention. </p>
  <p>Within the first minute of what Lintu brought out of this orchestra for this 
  symphony I knew I was listening to the sort of performance I would long remember 
  both for the immediate listening and for its prompting of some rethinking. At 
  least for his chosen music, Lintu is a man who knows what he wants and how to 
  get it. The orchestra looked and sounded invested, rather than merely professional. 
  They were having fun and it showed in a way that I had thought it had not, for 
  instance, when Alan Gilbert had them play the six Nielsen symphonies a few years 
  back. This performance was more like the Minnesota’s of Nielsen’s third symphony 
  under Osmo Vämskä at Carnegie Hall way back in 2011, which I tend to regard as 
  the best performance I’ve ever heard of any one piece. Last night, Sibelius’s 
  seventh <span class="emphasis">breathed</span>, in and out, on scales both long 
  and short, fluid and natural, emotional and witty. It’s not as if I have a shortage 
  of good recordings by top orchestras to listen to on my new mission to familiarise 
  myself with this symphony, but none will equal what I’ve just heard from the New 
  York Philharmonic under Lintu. </p>
