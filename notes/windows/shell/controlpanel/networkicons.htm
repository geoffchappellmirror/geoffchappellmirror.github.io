  <h1>Unhide Two Network Icons in the Control Panel </h1>
  <p>The Control Panel in Windows Vista has two namespace items that ordinarily 
  do not show as icons when the Control Panel is opened. They are fully operational 
  but are configured with the non-enumerated attribute. To make these items show 
  in the Control Panel is as simple as clearing the non-enumerated bit in their 
  attributes as shell folders. </p>
  <img alt="Connect To" src="_images/connectto.jpg" width="70" height="81">
  <img alt="Network Map" src="_images/networkmap.jpg" width="70" height="81">
  <p>Both items, it must be said, do nothing that cannot be reached from the “Network 
  and Sharing Center” item. Though someone may find it useful to get to these items 
  without having to open the Network and Sharing Center, this note really is intended 
  only as a diversion or at most as a quick lesson in the shell namespace. </p>
  <p>That said, the Connect To item is thought important enough by Microsoft to 
  warrant an entry on the Start Menu, in the new style only, on the right side with 
  other “system” links. So, if users did want to see the item in the Control Panel, 
  or even on the desktop, the desire can’t very well be dismissed as unanticipated.
  </p>
  <h2>Connect To </h2>
  <p>To open the Connect To item directly from the Control Panel is essentially 
  to click on “Connect to a Network” from among the Tasks shown in the Network and 
  Sharing Center. Both end up calling the <span class="function">RunVAN</span> function 
  in VAN.DLL. The former does it in a separate RUNDLL32 process, the latter merely 
  in a separate thread. </p>
  <p>Windows is installed with no category for the Connect To item, which therefore 
  shows under Additional Options. </p>
  <h2>Network Map </h2>
  <p>To open the Network Map item directly from the Control Panel is essentially 
  to click on “View full map” near the top right of the Network and Sharing Center. 
  Indeed, when you do the latter, you just get NETCENTER.DLL to open the Network 
  Map item for you, but with all the overhead of going through the
  <span class="function">ShellExecute</span> function. </p>
  <p>Windows is installed with the Network Map item already assigned to the “Network 
  and Internet” category. </p>
  <h2>Explanation </h2>
  <p>Every shell folder is represented by a CLSID, which is a 16-byte identifier 
  often represented in string form as a sequence of hexadecimal numbers, with some 
  hyphens, enclosed in curly braces. </p>
  <p>A shell folder is in the Control Panel namespace if its CLSID, with curly braces, 
  is defined as a subkey of any of several namespace keys for the Control Panel, 
  the most important of which are: </p>
  <ul>
    <li><span class="regkey">HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\ControlPanel\NameSpace</span>
    </li>
    <li><span class="regkey">HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\ControlPanel\NameSpace</span>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>(A detailed description of the Control Panel namespace is under development, 
  presently at the page <span class="class">
  <a href="../../../../studies/windows/shell/shell32/classes/controlpanel.htm">ControlPanel</a></span> 
  in the shell study.) The CLSIDs for the two items in question are: </p>
  <table>
    <tr>
      <td><span class="clsid">{38A98528-6CBF-4CA9-8DC0-B1E1D10F7B1B}</span> </td>
      <td>for Connect To </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><span class="clsid">{E7DE9B1A-7533-4556-9484-B26FB486475E}</span> </td>
      <td>for Network Map </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  <p>As for any shell folder, each has a configuration in terms of registry keys 
  and values under <span class="regkey">HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\CLSID\<span class="placeholder">clsid</span></span>. 
  The shell-folder attributes for an item are read from the registry value </p>
  <table class="Registry">
    <tr>
      <td>Key: </td>
      <td><span class="regkey">HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\CLSID\<span class="placeholder">clsid</span>\ShellFolder</span>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Value: </td>
      <td><span class="regvalue">Attributes</span> </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Type: </td>
      <td><span class="constant">REG_DWORD</span> </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  <p>While the 0x00100000 (<span class="constant">SFGAO_NONENUMERATED</span>) bit 
  is set in the dword of data, the item is exempt from enumeration in any folder 
  that contains it. Although both items are already defined in the Control Panel 
  namespace, they do not show in the Control Panel unless this bit is clear. </p>
  <h3>Directions </h3>
  <p>However, clearing this bit in these keys is not the best way to allow the item 
  to be enumerated. Windows is installed with the TrustedInstaller account as owner 
  of these keys, with permissions set so that even administrators cannot write to 
  these keys without first taking ownership. Instead, override the one value that 
  needs to change. This can be done in the per-user branch from which the merged 
  key <span class="regkey">HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT</span> is drawn. For the current user, 
  set the following registry value: </p>
  <table class="Registry">
    <tr>
      <td>Key: </td>
      <td><span class="regkey">HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Classes\CLSID\<span class="placeholder">clsid</span>\ShellFolder</span>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Value: </td>
      <td><span class="regvalue">Attributes</span> </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Type: </td>
      <td><span class="constant">REG_DWORD</span> </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  <p>You typically will have to create this key. Indeed, on a fresh installation, 
  you will have to start creating subkeys all the way back at
  <span class="regkey">CLSID</span>. Take the dword of <span class="regvalue">Attributes</span> 
  data from the key in <span class="regkey">HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT</span>, clear the 
  0x00100000 bit, and set it into the key in <span class="regkey">HKEY_CURRENT_USER</span>.
  </p>
  <h2>Programmatic Access </h2>
  <p>Even while these items are not enumerated, they are accessible in the shell 
  namespace and may therefore be opened programmatically, including from a Command 
  Prompt through such commands as </p>
  <pre class="input">explorer ::{21ec2020-3aea-1069-a2dd-08002b30309d}\::{<span class="placeholder">clsid</span>}</pre>
  <pre class="input">explorer ::{26ee0668-a00a-44d7-9371-beb064c98683}\<span class="placeholder">category</span>\::{<span class="placeholder">clsid</span>}</pre>
  <p>in which <span class="placeholder">category</span> is a decimal representation 
  of the Control Panel category to which the item is assigned. This must be 3 for 
  Network Map, to represent the “Network and Internet” category. For the Connect 
  To item, which is not assigned to a category, use 0 or any valid category number 
  (meaning 1 to 11 inclusive in Windows Vista). </p>
