<h1>DESCRIPTION </h1>
<p>The <span class="def">DESCRIPTION</span> statement is supported only when 
building an export file for a VxD. It is otherwise ignored after a warning 
(LNK4017). </p>
<h2>Syntax </h2>
<p><span class="def">DESCRIPTION</span> is a single-definition statement. It is 
a fatal error (LNK1118) if the statement is empty. The <span class="def">
DESCRIPTION</span> 
tag must be followed by a space or tab. There may then be any amount of white 
space, including none, before the definition. The ordinary syntax is: </p>
<blockquote>
  <p><span class="def">DESCRIPTION </span><span class="placeholder">text</span><span class="def">
  </span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>such that <span class="placeholder">text</span> truly is all the text on the 
remainder of the line (including trailing white space). A variation is: </p>
<blockquote>
  <p><span class="def">DESCRIPTION &#39;</span><span class="placeholder">text</span><span class="def">&#39;
  </span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here, the first character of the argument is a single-quote, and
<span class="placeholder">text</span> begins with the next character and 
continues up to but not including the last single-quote on the remainder of the 
line. It is a fatal error (LNK1118) if there is not another single-quote on the 
line. Characters beyond the last single-quote are irrelevant and are ignored 
without complaint.
</p>
<h2>Command-Line Translation </h2>
<p>The <span class="def">DESCRIPTION</span> statement translates to a
<span class="switch">/comment</span> option for the export-file command line. 
The form is: </p>
<blockquote>
  <p><span class="switch">/COMMENT:&quot;</span><span class="placeholder">text</span><span class="switch">&quot;
  </span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>where <span class="placeholder">text</span> is from the <span class="def">
DESCRIPTION</span> 
statement, as described above, but at most the first 117 bytes of it. </p>
<h3>Buffer Overrun </h3>
<p>The need to limit the amount of <span class="placeholder">text</span> that 
carries to the command-line option arises because LIB prepares the command-line 
option in a buffer that is set up on the stack as a local variable, whose size 
is therefore set in the source code and not adjustable at run time. The buffer’s 
size is 128 bytes. The <span class="switch">/comment</span> switch, its colon 
and a pair of double-quotes total 11 bytes. This would leave 117 bytes for the
<span class="placeholder">text</span>. </p>
<p>However, a null byte must yet terminate the string that LIB prepares in this 
buffer. If the <span class="placeholder">text</span> in the <span class="def">
DESCRIPTION</span> 
statement does run to 117 bytes or more, then although LIB copies only the first 
117 bytes to the stack as <span class="placeholder">text</span> for the
<span class="switch">/comment</span> switch, the null terminator is one byte too 
many for the buffer on the stack. </p>
<p>It happens that in the version inspected for these notes, namely 7.00.9466, 
the buffer in which LIB prepares the <span class="switch">/comment</span> switch 
is placed highest among the relevant procedure’s local variables. Ordinarily, 
the one-byte overrun would therefore corrupt this procedure’s return address. 
However, the procedure has been compiled with the Buffer Security Check enabled, 
to detect overruns that would overwrite the return address. This gives a ready 
demonstration both of the coding error and of the efficacy of the Buffer 
Security Check. </p>
<h4>Demonstration </h4>
<p>Begin with a module definition file, here named TEST.DEF, containing just the 
following as one (long) line: </p>
<pre class="source">DESCRIPTION 12345678901234567890...1234567</pre>
<p>where the ellipsis stands for as many repetitions of 1234567890 as needed for 
the <span class="placeholder">text</span> argument to count to 117. Running </p>
<pre class="input">lib /def:test.def /machine:x86 /vxd</pre>
<p>triggers the buffer overrun. Repeat with <span class="placeholder">text</span> 
reduced by one byte, and there is no buffer overrun. </p>
<h3>White Space and Quotes </h3>
<p>Note that <span class="placeholder">text</span> with white space need not be 
enclosed in quotes of either sort when given in the <span class="def">
DESCRIPTION</span> 
statement. All the white space gets enclosed in double-quotes when carried to 
the
<span class="switch">/comment</span> option. This is true even of trailing white 
space, such as occurs if <span class="placeholder">text</span> without 
single-quotes is followed by white space and then by a comment. (Remember that 
by this stage of parsing, LIB treats a comment as having ended the line.) </p>
<p>Enclosure between single-quotes in the <span class="def">DESCRIPTION</span> 
statement is supported explicitly and has the merit of marking clearly which 
characters are intended as the <span class="placeholder">text</span> for the
<span class="switch">/comment</span> option. Double-quotes in the
<span class="placeholder">text</span> are problematic. They carry into the
<span class="placeholder">text</span> for the <span class="switch">/comment</span> 
option in the export file, but the enclosure in double-quotes for the option 
inverts the pairing of the double-quotes in the definition. </p>
