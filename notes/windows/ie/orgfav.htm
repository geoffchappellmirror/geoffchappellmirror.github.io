  <h1>Organize Favorites by Opening as a Folder </h1>
  <p>Internet Explorer has long arranged that each user has a special folder, named 
  Favorites, in which to keep shortcuts to favourite web pages. The links represented 
  by these shortcut files are made readily accessible by mapping the folder to the 
  browser’s main menu, under Favorites. If the shortcuts are organised in subfolders, 
  then they show in cascading submenus of the Favorites menu. As if this is not 
  handy enough, the browser can also be asked to present the same Favorites in an 
  Explorer Bar as a left pane in the browser’s main window, with the links now shown 
  as an expandable multi-level indented list. </p>
  <p>The Favorites menu also can call up dialog boxes for adding a link to the Favorites 
  and for organising whatever links are already there. Again, the emphasis is on 
  easy access to the user’s favourite links. Indeed, there is too much accessibility 
  for some tastes: both these dialog boxes can be opened for you by script on a 
  web page! </p>

  <p>This user interface for organising favourites does have the merit of sparing 
  users from grappling with their links as shortcut files in some folder that is 
  who knows where within a possibly very large file system. However, not all users 
  are frightened by exposure to files and directories, and some may even resent 
  having to work through somebody else’s idea of a helpful layer of user-interface 
  crud. </p>
  <p>It happens that there does exist a facility for getting quickly to whatever 
  directory Internet Explorer treats as your Favorites folder and from there to 
  work with your favourites exactly as you might with any other files in any other 
  folder. As so often however, Microsoft seems not to have documented this alternative 
  user interface until long after its introduction and even now documents it only 
  obscurely. </p>
  <h2>Directions </h2>
  <p>When selecting “Organize Favorites...” from the browser’s Favorites menu, hold 
  down the Shift key. Then, instead of presenting the usual dialog box, as described 
  above, the browser simply opens your Favorites folder, and you may operate on 
  the shortcut files with whatever practices you have developed for files in any 
  other folder. </p>
  <h2>Applicability </h2>
  <p>This feature dates from at least 1996 (certainly with Windows 95 OSR2) and 
  continues into Windows Vista. </p>
  <h3>Documentation Status </h3>
  <p>The only documentation I yet know from Microsoft is among the tips listed by 
  Microsoft’s
  <a target="_top" href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/pro/downloads/powertoys.asp">
  Tweak UI for Windows XP</a> program. </p>
  <h3>Technical Reference </h3>
  <p>For most of the relevant history, the Organize Favorites dialog box is implemented 
  in SHDOCVW.DLL and is opened programmatically by calling the exported function
  <span class="function">DoOrganizeFavDlg</span>. The dialog box and function are 
  both present in most builds of SHDOCVW version 4.70, specifically from Windows 
  95 OSR2 and Internet Explorer 3.01 and 3.02, but not an Internet Explorer 3.00 
  from earlier in 1996. The function was still undocumented at least as late as 
  the January 2004 edition of the MSDN Library on CD, but has got documented since. 
  In the SDK for Windows Vista, dated January 2007, Microsoft puts the function’s 
  “minimum availability” as “Internet Explorer 4.0”. </p>
  <p>Dependence on the Shift key comes from the sequence of routines that handle 
  the <span class="message">WM_COMMAND</span> message that Internet Explorer’s main 
  window receives when the “Organize Favorites...” menu entry is selected. The routine 
  at the end calls <span class="function">DoOrganizeFavDlg</span> if the Shift key 
  is not down, else it opens the Favorites folder. These routines, which Microsoft’s 
  symbol files tell us are the <span class="member">OnCommand</span>,
  <span class="member">_FavoriteOnCommand</span> and <span class="member">_OrganizeFavorites</span> 
  member functions of a class named <span class="class">CShellBrowser2</span>, originated 
  in SHDOCVW but were moved to BROWSEUI.DLL in version 5.0, i.e., for Internet 
  Explorer 5.0, Windows 98 SE and Windows 2000. </p>
  <p>In Windows Vista, all the code cited above is moved to IEFRAME.DLL. As far 
  as concerns the “Organize Favorites...” menu entry, the Shift key and the choice 
  of opening the dialog box or the folder, this has all been the same code all the 
  while, even keeping the same resource ID for the menu entry. It’s just that the 
  code has been split, moved and regathered according to Microsoft’s whim about 
  how Windows and Internet Explorer are integrated, separated or whatever. </p>

    3rd April 2021). </p>
