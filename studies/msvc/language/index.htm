<h1>The C/C++ Language </h1>
<p>Microsoft’s implementation of the C and C++ languages for the Visual C++ product 
has its various deliberate extensions and quirks and outright defects. </p>
<p>Some may get written up here, and even set into a framework, but even if this 
exercise ever amounts to a systematic presentation of how Microsoft treats the language, 
it is absolutely not my intention to write anything like a primer on C or C++ as 
programming languages. The assumption through all these notes is, and always will 
be, that the subject is Microsoft’s implementation of the languages, without regard 
for any standard, let alone for any other implementations. </p>
<p>Moreover, the focus is firmly on C++, as implemented in C1XX.DLL, which is the 
front-end C++ compiler. If some point is made without speaking specifically about 
C, it is not because the point applies equally to C and C++ but because the C compiler 
(C1.DLL) simply has not been studied on the point. </p>
<p>There is also a general restriction of scope concerning errors. These notes generally 
take the view that all errors are effectively fatal. Where an error is not actually 
declared a fatal error, it is generous of the compiler to continue (especially so 
that the programmer may attend to multiple errors in one go, before recompiling), 
but it is the first error that counts: if the code is to compile, the programmer 
cannot avoid attending to that first error. It is important that the message displayed 
for the first error be accurate—perhaps not complete, but at least not misleading—which 
is why these notes do take the trouble to cite error numbers that follow from failing 
to meet some expectation of the language. However, quirks in the compiler’s sometimes 
valiant attempts at continuing after an error are not reasonable objects of criticism 
and are ignored for these notes—except, of course, if they are so spectacularly 
bizarre that I can’t resist. </p>
<p>It may be some time before what gets written here is anything but random and 
sparse. The undertaking is huge, its continuation is uncertain and its particular 
points of interest to me on any one visit to the work are highly variable. That 
said, the product documentation is too often incorrect and incomplete—embarrasingly 
so, one might think, given Microsoft’s resources and the profits that Microsoft 
makes at least indirectly from the Visual C++ product. I therefore have concluded 
that it’s better to publish fragments and unannotated lists than to leave information 
sitting in a virtual drawer gathering virtual dust awaiting satisfaction of my usual 
and obsessive desire for completeness. For your part, exercise more than your usual 
caution about believing what you read. </p>
