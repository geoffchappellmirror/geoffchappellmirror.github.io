  <h1>Licensed Processors in Windows Vista </h1>
  <p>Microsoft’s license terms for Windows Vista, even for the Starter edition, 
  state plainly that the software may be used “on up to two processors on” the licensed 
  “device at one time”. What isn’t spelled out is whether the processors to be counted 
  for this limit are physical or logical. In the experience of using Windows, there 
  is generally no distinction. For instance, a dual-core CPU shows in the Device 
  Manager as two processors, with no very obvious indication that these are logical 
  processors in the one physical package. Especially as the day cannot be far off 
  that Intel’s advertisements on television sing the wonders not only of dual-core 
  but quad-core processors, it might be thought that Microsoft’s lawyers would want 
  to clarify that the license applies specifically to physical processors. Such 
  clarification might then be the end of the matter, but there are quirks. </p>
  <h2>Home Editions </h2>
  <p>For one thing, <span class="highlight">the legalese’s restriction to two processors 
  is not factually correct for all editions</span>, even with it understood as counting 
  only physical processors. Some editions of Windows Vista are distributed with 
  license values that permit just one physical processor. </p>
  <p>The permitted number of processors is configured through the license value
  <span class="licvalue">Kernel-RegisteredProcessors</span>, as extracted from binary 
  data for the <span class="regvalue">ProductPolicy</span> value in the registry 
  key <span class="regkey">HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\ProductOptions</span>. 
  Though the Business, Business N and Ultimate editions do indeed have
  <span class="licvalue">Kernel-RegisteredProcessors</span> set to 2, it is just 
  1 for the Starter, Home Basic, Home Basic N and Home Premium editions. </p>
  <p>Few users of these reduced editions may ever be troubled by the difference: 
  even a quad-core processor counts as one for the license value, and machines with 
  two physical processors will not be selling in quantity on the high street any 
  time soon, if ever. Nonetheless, motherboards with two CPU sockets do exist and 
  a search through Google shows soon enough that people have been caught unaware. 
  Yet even if relative scarcity means there is little harm in total, what does it 
  say of Microsoft’s notions of software licensing that Microsoft goes to the trouble 
  of developing a formal scheme of named license values, includes one for limiting 
  the number of processors, configures different limits for different editions, 
  yet doesn’t make sure that the corresponding legal text is accurate with respect 
  to these different limits? </p>
  <p>Eventually, Microsoft may correct the legal text, or at least elaborate it 
  somehow. There may someday, somewhere, be a clear statement by Microsoft that 
  the restriction to one physical processor for the various Starter and Home editions 
  is a licensing issue, not some technical constraint. Meanwhile, the closest that 
  pages like
  <a target="_top" href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/products/windowsvista/editions/systemrequirements.mspx">
  Windows Vista: Recommended System Requirements</a> seem able to come is “While 
  all editions of Windows Vista can support multiple core CPUs, only Windows Vista 
  Business, Ultimate and Enterprise can support dual processors”. </p>
  <p>By the way, if you do have dual processors in combination with one of the lesser 
  editions of Windows Vista, then do not naively change the
  <span class="regvalue">ProductPolicy</span> value in the registry in the hope 
  of inducing Windows to rise to the behaviour suggested by Microsoft’s legalese. 
  Not only may changing it transgress laws about modifying software to defeat license 
  terms, but Windows does have various run-time mechanisms for protecting the integrity 
  of the license values. </p>
  <h2>Penalty </h2>
  <p>What happens if Windows is run on a machine with more processors than are licensed? 
  It would be naive to imagine that Windows just doesn’t notice, or even that Windows 
  does nothing about an excess until the time comes for what the license terms refer 
  to as a validation. A natural expectation is that each time Windows enumerates 
  the processors, as it must for instance when initialising, it will use those that 
  are within the licensed limit but not use any that are unlicensed. And, indeed, 
  it doesn’t use excess processors. But that is not the whole of it. There is a 
  penalty. <span class="highlight">The price for starting Windows with even one 
  unlicensed processor is that the kernel disables its support for the CPU feature 
  known formally as Page Size Extensions (PSE) and known commonly as
  <span class="definition">large pages</span>.</span> </p>
  <p>This feature enables physical memory to be mapped into linear address space 
  not only in 4KB pages, as usual, but also in 2MB or 4MB pages (depending on whether 
  another feature, not directly relevant, is enabled). The large pages trade fine 
  control for easier, quicker mapping. The advantage in faster access to frequently-used 
  memory can be significant. Quite why this benefit should be lost as the penalty 
  for having too many processors is anyone’s guess. Microsoft seems not even to 
  document that any penalty is applied, let alone this one, let alone why. Yet its 
  introduction is plainly a deliberate coding, introduced for Windows Server 2003 
  SP2 and maintained at least until Windows 7. </p>
  <p>Microsoft may have a legal right to degrade its product in response to hardware 
  that exceeds the license terms, and to do so however Microsoft wants. A case might 
  be made that Microsoft would be generous just to ignore the excess hardware, and 
  at least the penalty applies just to the infringing session and is entirely remediable 
  just by removing or disabling the unlicensed hardware. That said, since Microsoft 
  does not notify the user that the licence is supposedly breached, one might think 
  that Microsoft would take special care to be sure that its supposition is correct 
  beyond dispute and that the license limit is accurately documented. As things 
  stand now, the loss of large-page support is the only notification and Microsoft 
  seems nowhere to document that this penalty actually is incurred. Worse, as noted 
  in the next paragraph but explained in detail elsewhere, the penalty can be incurred 
  even without a breach. </p>
  <h2>The NUMPROC Boot Option </h2>
  <p>Uncertainty about whether the license limit counts logical or physical processors 
  makes for a complicated interaction with the <span class="bcdopt">
  <a href="../boot/bcd/osloader/numproc.htm">numproc</a></span> boot option, explained 
  separately. A quick summary is that setting <span class="bcdopt">numproc</span> 
  on a machine with multiple logical processors may disable large-page support because 
  a coding error causes one of the logical processors to be treated as an unlicensed 
  physical processor. Microsoft fixed this in Windows Vista SP1. </p>
  <h2>Technical Details </h2>
  <p>That the license value is counted in physical processors is deduced from the 
  kernel’s code for enumerating logical processors during initialisation. The following 
  summary simplifies by assuming that <span class="bcdopt">numproc</span> is absent 
  (and also that the kernel is not passed a <span class="switch">/BOOTPROC</span> 
  switch, in Windows Vista SP1 and higher). </p>
  <p>The kernel first reads the <span class="licvalue">Kernel-RegisteredProcessors</span> 
  license value into an internal kernel variable. The kernel is at the time executing 
  on the so-called boot processor. Regarding this as the first logical processor 
  of a first physical processor, the kernel then proceeds to enumerate other logical 
  processors. Each new logical processor may be in the same physical package as 
  one that has already been enumerated, or not. </p>
  <p>If it is not, then it is the first logical processor for a new physical processor 
  and is counted against the license value. The implementation is simply that if 
  the number of processors that have yet been accepted has already reached the licensed 
  allowance, then this new physical processor is unlicensed and cannot be accepted 
  for use. The kernel continues enumerating, but only in the hope of discovering 
  additional logical processors for physical processors that have been accepted 
  as licensed. </p>
  <p>When a newly enumerated logical processor is in the same physical package as 
  one that has already been accepted for use, the kernel simply increments the licensed 
  allowance and accepts the new logical processor. This models the notion that additional 
  logical processors of a licensed physical processor are included automatically 
  in the licensed allowance. The license limit is therefore a count of physical 
  processors. </p>
