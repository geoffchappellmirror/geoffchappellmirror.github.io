<h1>ServiceMain </h1>
<p>A service DLL in a <a href="../index.htm">SVCHOST</a> process exports this function 
as its entry point for starting services. </p>
<h2>Declaration </h2>
<pre class="source">VOID WINAPI ServiceMain (DWORD dwArgc, LPWSTR *lpszArgv); </pre>
<h3>Parameters </h3>
<p>The <span class="argument">dwArgc</span> argument is the number of null-terminated 
Unicode strings described by the <span class="argument">lpszArgv</span> argument. 
The first such string is the (case-insensitive) name of the service that is being 
started. </p>
<h2>Behaviour </h2>
<p>The <span class="function">ServiceMain</span> function for a service that is 
implemented in a service DLL running in a SVCHOST instance is essentially the same 
as if the service were implemented in a service program. The essential differences 
are that: </p>
<ul>
  <li>only the Unicode version of the prototype is supported; </li>
  <li>the function must be exported by name; </li>
  <li>if the name is not <span class="function">ServiceMain</span>, then it must 
  be configured in the registry as the data for the following value: </li>
</ul>
<table class="Registry">
  <tr>
    <td>Key </td>
    <td><span class="regkey">HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\<span class="placeholder">service</span>\Parameters</span>
    <br>
    <span class="regkey">HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\<span class="placeholder">service</span></span>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Value </td>
    <td><span class="regvalue">ServiceMain</span> </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Type </td>
    <td><span class="constant">REG_SZ</span> </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Default </td>
    <td><span class="regsz">ServiceMain</span> </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>where <span class="placeholder">service</span> is the name of the service that 
is being started. Until SVCHOST version 6.0, the value can be in the
<span class="regkey">Parameters</span> subkey only. Version 6.00 accepts a value 
in the parent key if the <span class="regkey">Parameters</span> subkey is not present.
</p>
<p>Although a service DLL is unlikely in practice to implement more than one service, 
it is not restricted to just the one, and it can export as many
<span class="function">ServiceMain</span> functions as it cares to. It can have 
one <span class="function">ServiceMain</span> to handle the start of any service, 
relying on the first string described by <span class="argument">lpszArgv</span> 
to indicate which service is being started. At the other extreme, it can have one
<span class="function">ServiceMain</span> for each service, all named differently, 
all (or all but one) configured in the registry. </p>
<p>A <span class="function">ServiceMain</span> function in a service DLL can be 
coded as for one in a service program. Refer to Microsoft’s documentation. However, 
some work that might be done in a service program can be avoided in a service DLL 
because it is already done by SVCHOST. First, there is
<a href="../process/index.htm">per-process initialisation</a> which is not only 
convenient to be done by SVCHOST but is perhaps better attempted only once per process 
(as with initialising COM security). Second, though only since version 5.1, SVCHOST 
provides service DLLs with access to shared code and data. To learn the addresses, 
a service DLL should export a function named <span class="function">
<a href="svchostpushserviceglobals.htm">SvchostPushServiceGlobals</a></span>, which 
SVCHOST calls before each call to any <span class="function">ServiceMain</span> 
function in the DLL. </p>
<p>An important, though recent, feature of the shared code is to provide service 
DLLs with a very slight change of coding that allows SVCHOST to unload a service 
DLL that is no longer in use. To obtain this benefit, where a service program would 
call the KERNEL32 function <span class="function">RegisterWaitForSingleObject</span> 
to arrange a callback for stopping a service, a service DLL instead calls the SVCHOST 
function <span class="function"><a href="../process/registerstopcallback.htm">RegisterStopCallback</a></span>.
</p>
<p>In version 6.0, SVCHOST logs each call to <span class="function">ServiceMain</span> 
as an event, such that it may be retrieved through the Event Viewer in the Diagnostic 
channel under the heading Microsoft Windows Services Svchost Performance Diagnostic 
Provider. Each call is preceded by event 101 and each return is marked as event 
102. For both, the event data is the service’s name. This event log provides ready 
confirmation that many services implemented in service DLLs do not return from
<span class="function">ServiceMain</span> until stopped. </p>
<h2>Availability </h2>
<p>The <span class="function">ServiceMain</span> function in service DLLs is supported 
by SVCHOST.EXE in all known versions (5.0 and higher). </p>
