  <h1>Kernel Exports Added For Version 3.50 </h1>
  <p>This page lists the 146 functions and variables that are newly exported from 
  the Windows kernel in version 3.50. It is here thought that no service packs of 
  version 3.50 added to these exports, but beware that only SP3 has yet been obtained 
  for inspection. </p>
  <h2>Conventions </h2>
  <!--webbot bot="Include" U-Include="_include/conventions.htm" TAG="BODY" startspan -->

<p>To convey more detail with less text, the page relies heavily on several types 
of shortcut. </p>

<!--webbot bot="Include" endspan i-checksum="31086" -->
  <!--webbot bot="Include" U-Include="_include/variables.htm" TAG="BODY" startspan -->

<p>The first is that although a few of the kernel’s exports are of variables rather 
than functions, I tend to talk of all as functions, hoping that no confusion will 
be caused by the loose terminology. The variables are indicated by a parenthetical 
“data” after their first appearance in the Functions column. </p>

<!--webbot bot="Include" endspan i-checksum="20269" -->
  <h3>Colours </h3>
  <!--webbot bot="Include" U-Include="../../_include/colours.htm" TAG="BODY" startspan -->

<p>Documentation status is summarised by colour coding. <span class="NoScript">(Had 
the website’s scripts run as expected, then hovering over any colour-coded text 
would produce a tooltip that shows why the text is coloured.) </span>
<span class="ScriptOnly">(To decode a colour, hover for a tooltip.) </span></p>
<p>Functions that appear to be completely undocumented are
<span class="undocumented">highlighted yellow</span>. If a function is documented 
now but was not documented in the first contemporaneous Device Driver Kit (DDK), 
Windows Driver Kit (WDK) or Installable File System (IFS) Kit, then it is
<span class="delayed">shaded yellow</span> to retain some of its previous status. 
If a function is documented as reserved or obsolete, it is
<span class="reserved">shaded red</span> or <span class="obsolete">shaded grey</span>, 
respectively. Otherwise, functions that have their own non-trivial documentation 
are left with no background colour. </p>
<p>Many undocumented functions and some variables have C-language declarations in 
one or another header file. To show them as being not completely undocumented they 
are <span class="declared">shaded orange</span>, except for one special case. Some 
declarations are known only from “minwin” headers that Microsoft published in early 
editions of the WDK for Windows 10 which seem since to have been withdrawn. These 
are <span class="minwin">highlighted orange</span> to indicate that public disclosure 
even of the declaration was exceptional. </p>

<!--webbot bot="Include" endspan i-checksum="57742" -->
  <h3>Actual Availability </h3>
  <!--webbot bot="Include" U-Include="_include/exporthistory.htm" TAG="BODY" startspan -->

<p>The default understanding is that exporting continues for all later versions, 
and in both the x86 and x64 builds. Exceptions are sketched in a column headed Export 
History. </p>

<!--webbot bot="Include" endspan i-checksum="64859" -->
  <!--webbot bot="Include" U-Include="_include/x86only.htm" TAG="BODY" startspan -->

<p>The description “x86 only” means that the function is not exported from any known 
x64 build but is exported from the x86 build of at least some version that has an 
x64 build. If it had already ceased as an export before Windows Server 2003 SP1, 
the “x86 only” is left unstated. </p>

<!--webbot bot="Include" endspan i-checksum="43035" -->
  <!--webbot bot="Include" U-Include="_include/discontinued.htm" TAG="BODY" startspan -->

<p>That a function is “discontinued in” some version means that the function is 
exported up to but not including the stated version and not in any later version 
unless “restored”. </p>

<!--webbot bot="Include" endspan i-checksum="31363" -->
  <h3>Documented Availability </h3>
  <!--webbot bot="Include" U-Include="_include/docdeclhistory.htm" TAG="BODY" startspan -->

<p>It’s nothing but fair to note that the majority of these functions were not documented 
immediately. Even more were then or later said to require later versions. These 
misrepresentations of actual availability show also in C-language declarations for 
the functions’ use in programming. Conveying these differences between what the 
kernel exported and what Microsoft presented for drivers to import is the concern 
of columns headed Documentation History and Declaration History. </p>
<p class="alert">Conventions still in development! </p>

<!--webbot bot="Include" endspan i-checksum="26474" -->
  <h4>Incompleteness </h4>
  <p>While no DDK for Windows NT 3.50 is found for reference, the default assumption 
  throughout the following table is that whatever is known about a function’s documentation 
  or declarations from the DDK for Windows NT 3.51 can’t be said to have differed 
  for version 3.50. </p>
  <!--webbot bot="Include" U-Include="_include/missingifskits.htm" TAG="BODY" startspan -->

<p>Many functions in these early versions may have got their first documentation 
or declaration because their use was specially anticipated for installable file 
system (IFS) drivers. Microsoft published a separate IFS Kit for these, apparently 
starting from Windows 2000. For Windows Vista, the IFS Kit was merged into the WDK. 
Between, there are known to have been IFS Kits for Windows XP and Windows Server 
2003, but I have not obtained either for inspection. Where applicable DDK versions 
are left to the imprecision of “5.1 (IFS) to 6.0”, whatever is described is known 
from the IFS section of the WDK for Windows Vista and is excluded from the IFS Kit 
for Windows 2000 and from the ordinary DDK for all of Windows 2000, Windows XP and 
Windows Server 2003. </p>

<!--webbot bot="Include" endspan i-checksum="45831" -->
  <h2>Tabulation </h2>
  <!--webbot bot="Include" U-Include="_include/tabulation.htm" TAG="BODY" startspan -->

<p>As much as I might like to condense into one table as much as might be imagined 
is possible to summarise about all these functions’ history of availability both 
in the binary and according to the documentation and headers, many functions both 
individually and in groups demand additional explanation in text. I therefore break 
the tabulation according to Microsoft’s scheme of prefixes for separate areas of 
functionality within the otherwise monolithic kernel. Each function has its own 
row in one table, but please be sure to check for explanatory text before and (more 
usually) after the table. </p>

  <p>Documentation of <span class="function">KeDeregisterBugCheckCallback</span> 
  and <span class="function">KeRegisterBugCheckCallback</span> is marked “This is 
  preliminary documentation and subject to change” in the DDK for Windows XP.
  </p>
  <p>Though <span class="function">KeEnterCriticalRegion</span> and
  <span class="function">KeLeaveCriticalRegion</span> plainly are a pair, the one 
  needing always to be balanced by the other, one preceded the other as an exported 
  function. It is here thought that <span class="function">KeEnterCriticalRegion</span> 
  existed in version 3.10 only as the same macro that Microsoft published in NTDDK.H 
  for versions 3.51 up to and including 5.1 (presumably by oversight since it cannot 
  compile without a definition of the <span class="member">KernelApcDisable</span> 
  member of the opaque <span class="struct">KTHREAD</span>). </p>
  <p>What documentation I see online today, 17th September 2020, for
  <span class="delayed function">KefReleaseSpinLockFromDpcLevel</span> is dated 
  30th April 2018 as is most other online documentation since Microsoft’s reorganisation 
  of it in terms of which headers declare which functions. Who knows when this documentation 
  was written but its publication plausibly is just a side-effect of the reorganisation. 
  What little is presented as Remarks is just for the long-documented
  <span class="function">KeReleaseSpinLockFromDpcLevel</span> and the page has no 
  partner for <span class="declared function">KefAcquireSpinLockAtDpcLevel</span>. 
  Still, documented it is. </p>

  <h3><span class="functionprefix">Nt</span> Functions </h3>
  <!--webbot bot="Include" U-Include="_include/nt.htm" TAG="BODY" startspan -->

<p>The functions whose names begin with <span class="functionprefix">Nt</span> correspond 
closely to functions whose names have the <span class="functionprefix">Zw</span> 
prefix instead (see below). Put aside some general points about how the two differ—see
<a href="../../../win32/ntdll/api/native.htm">The Native API</a>— and documentation 
of an <span class="functionprefix">Nt</span> function is to a large extent implied 
by documentation of the corresponding <span class="functionprefix">Zw</span> function.
</p>
<p>Though this correspondence will have been understood well enough by all competent 
kernel-mode programmers, Microsoft didn’t make it explicit until some time after 
releasing the WDK for Windows Vista. This is here taken as an intention to leave 
the <span class="functionprefix">Nt</span> functions <span class="undocumented">
undocumented</span> (if not <span class="declared">declared</span>) before version 
6.1. </p>
<p>Documentation in the WDK for Windows 7 gives each
<span class="functionprefix">Nt</span> function its own page and directs attention 
to the page for the corresponding <span class="functionprefix">Zw</span> function. 
The <span class="functionprefix">Zw</span> documentation might then be treated as 
counting for both, except that the <span class="functionprefix">Nt</span> documentation 
warns expressly “Do not call this routine from kernel-mode code.” This is here taken 
as documenting the <span class="functionprefix">Nt</span> functions as
<span class="reserved">reserved</span> in version 6.1 (certainly for kernel-mode 
use, which is this survey’s focus). </p>
<p>Microsoft loosened the text significantly for Windows 8 to note that the
<span class="functionprefix">Nt</span> and <span class="functionprefix">Zw</span> 
versions “can behave differently” and to refer to a page of guidance. These changes, 
though slight, are taken here as formally permitting the
<span class="functionprefix">Nt</span> functions’ kernel-mode use, such that they 
must now be counted as documented (though <span class="delayed">delayed</span>).
</p>
<p>While each <span class="functionprefix">Nt</span> function is documented only 
by reference to the <span class="functionprefix">Zw</span> function, whatever documented 
availability Microsoft gives for the latter is here taken as intended also for the 
former. In the headers, however, the two functions necessarily each have their own 
declaration (if they have any), and so any “declared start” shown below is specifically 
for the <span class="functionprefix">Nt</span> function. </p>

  <p>Though <span class="delayed function">ZwQueryDirectoryFile</span> is documented 
  in the Windows 2000 IFS Kit, it comes with a warning in red that “This is preliminary 
  documentation and subject to change” and the NTIFS.H from the same kit does not 
  declare the function. Presumably, the documentation was settled in time for the 
  Windows XP IFS Kit and Microsoft has ever since meant that Windows XP is when 
  the function became documented for use. A declaration was perhaps also settled 
  on as early as the Windows XP IFS Kit. Certainly, a declaration is presented in 
  the WDK for Windoiws Vista, but with a conditional-compilation block that doesn’t 
  agree with the documentation. </p>

  <p>Visual Studio documentation has long documented the
  <span class="delayed reserved function">_abnormal_termination</span> function 
  indirectly as <span class="macro">AbnormalTermination</span>. Whether this is 
  presented as a macro or is said to be an “intrinsic function”, it is documented 
  for use in the <span class="keyword">__finally</span> block of a termination handler. 
  Documentation for Visual Studio 2012 gives the function its own page but is clear 
  that it “is not intended to be called from user code.” This is here taken as reason 
  to count the function (not the macro) as reserved. </p>
  <p>The <span class="undocumented function">_global_unwind2</span> function has 
  long been an internal routine for the CRT library’s implementation of several 
  functions: <span class="undocumented function">_except_handler2</span> (already 
  exported from the version 3.10 kernel); its successors (of which
  <span class="delayed function">_except_handler3</span> is an x86-only export for 
  version 5.0 and higher); and the documented CRT function
  <span class="function">longjmp</span> (which is not a kernel export for any x86 
  build of any version). The version 3.10 kernel has it but does not export it. 
  Why it ever got exported in kernel mode is not known. It anyway is not known ever 
  to have been documented, not only as an export from the kernel but even as an 
  implementation detail of Microsoft’s CRT library. That said, it is named on a 
  page of
  <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/cpp/c-runtime-library/internal-crt-globals-and-functions">
  Internal CRT Globals and Functions</a>, which seems to have been prepared for 
  Visual Studio 2015. </p>
  <p>Microsoft’s C++ compiler generates references to the <span class="delayed function">
  _purecall</span> function when a virtual function table is emitted for a base 
  class that has any pure virtual member function. The first explicit documentation 
  that I know of is that the function has its own page in the
  <span class="citation">Alphabetical Function Reference</span> within the
  <span class="citation">C Run-Time Library Reference</span> for Visual Studio 2012.

  <h2>Discontinued </h2>
  <p>If only for cross-referencing, note that a dozen of the kernel’s original exports 
  do not survive to version 3.50: </p>
  <ul>
    <li><span class="obsolete function">ExAcquireResourceShared</span> </li>
    <li><span class="obsolete function">ExConvertExclusiveToShared</span> </li>
    <li><span class="reserved function">ExDisableResourceBoost</span> </li>
    <li><span class="obsolete function">
    <a href="../api/ex/resource/isacquiredshared.htm">ExIsResourceAcquiredShared</a></span>
    </li>
    <li><span class="obsolete function">ExReleaseResource</span> </li>
    <li><span class="undocumented function">KeInitializePowerStatus</span> </li>
    <li><span class="undocumented function">KeInsertQueuePowerStatus</span> </li>
    <li><span class="undocumented function">KeRemoveQueuePowerStatus</span> </li>
    <li><span class="undocumented variable">KeTimeIncrement</span> </li>
    <li><span class="delayed function">ProbeForRead</span>, but see below </li>
    <li><span class="undocumented function">RtlGetHeapUserValue</span> </li>
    <li><span class="undocumented function">RtlSetHeapUserValue</span> </li>
  </ul>
  <p>None had yet been documented. Four were sooner (version 3.50) or later (5.0) 
  documented as obsolete, one as reserved. For who knows what reason, this pruning 
  temporarily removed <span class="delayed function">ProbeForRead</span>—but not 
  its close companion, <span class="delayed function">ProbeForWrite</span>—from 
  use by external callers such as drivers who surely would have valued it for validating 
  parameters received from user-mode callers. It doesn’t return to the interface 
  until version 5.0, but at least then it got documented. </p>
