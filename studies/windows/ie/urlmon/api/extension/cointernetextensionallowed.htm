<h1>CoInternetExtensionAllowed </h1>
<h2>Declaration </h2>
<pre class="source">BOOL
CoInternetExtensionAllowed (
    REFCLSID rclsid,
    DWORD flags);</pre>
<h3>Parameters </h3>
<p>The <span class="argument">rclsid</span> argument is a reference to the CLSID 
of the extension. </p>
<p>The <span class="argument">flags</span> argument is ignored. </p>
<h3>Return Value </h3>
<p>The function returns a boolean indicator of whether the given extension is allowed.
</p>
<h2>Behaviour </h2>
<p>Among the <a href="../transapi/features.htm">Internet security features</a> introduced 
with the URLMON version 6.00 from Windows XP SP2 is one for controlling which extensions 
are allowed. The name of this feature, both as a symbolic constant and a registry 
key, is <span class="constant">FEATURE_ADDON_MANAGEMENT</span>. If this feature 
is disabled, meaning that there is no management of add-ons, all extensions are 
allowed. Otherwise, extensions are subject to several forms of control. </p>
<h3>Extensions Off </h3>
<p>One way to control extensions, given URLMON version 7.00 or higher, is to turn 
them off <span class="foreign">en masse</span>. When extensions are off, only a 
relatively few so-called <a href="system.htm">system extensions</a> are allowed.
</p>
<p>Note that this is a run-time defence. Extensions are turned off by calling the
<span class="function"><a href="cointernetsetextensionsoff.htm">CoInternetSetExtensionsOff</a></span> 
function while <span class="constant">FEATURE_ADDON_MANAGEMENT</span> is not disabled. 
A corresponding function, <span class="function">
<a href="cointernetisextensionsoff.htm">CoInternetIsExtensionsOff</a></span>, reports 
whether extensions actually are off. </p>
<h3>Policy </h3>
<p>Extensions can be managed as administrative policy, both collectively and selectively. 
Whether a particular extension is allowed can be set as a registry value using the 
extension’s CLSID in either of two keys listed below in order of decreasing precedence:
</p>
<table class="Registry">
  <tr>
    <td>Key </td>
    <td><span class="regkey">HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\Ext\CLSID</span>
    <br>
    <span class="regkey">HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\Ext\CLSID</span>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Value </td>
    <td><span class="regvalue">{<span class="placeholder">clsid</span>}</span>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Data </td>
    <td><span class="regsz">0</span> if extension is disallowed; <br>
    <span class="regsz">1</span> if extension is allowed; <br>
    else extension is not managed by policy </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>Although URLMON interprets the data as a string, it does not enforce any particular 
type (such as <span class="constant">REG_SZ</span>). These settings for particular 
extensions have user-interface support through the Group Policy Object Editor, as 
the Add-on List in the folder Add-on Management among the Security Features in the 
Internet Explorer administrative template (displayed under Windows Components).
</p>
<p>Another setting covers extensions that do not have a registry value for their 
own CLSID: </p>
<table class="Registry">
  <tr>
    <td>Key </td>
    <td><span class="regkey">HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\Ext</span>
    <br>
    <span class="regkey">HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\Ext</span>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Value </td>
    <td><span class="regvalue">RestrictToList</span> </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Type </td>
    <td>boolean </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Default </td>
    <td>false </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>Evaluation as true means that the extension is disallowed by policy. Otherwise, 
is not managed by policy. This setting also has user-interface support, as “Deny 
all add-ons unless specifically allowed in the Add-on List” in the same folder of 
the Group Policy Object Editor. </p>
<h3>Preference </h3>
<p>If a system extension isn’t managed by policy, it is allowed. Other extensions 
that aren’t managed by policy can be disallowed selectively as preferences, i.e., 
in a user’s own registry settings or as machine-wide administrative guidance which 
users can override: </p>
<table class="Registry">
  <tr>
    <td>Key </td>
    <td><span class="regkey">HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Ext\Settings\{<span class="placeholder">clsid</span>}</span>
    <br>
    <span class="regkey">HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Ext\Settings\{<span class="placeholder">clsid</span>}</span>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Value </td>
    <td><span class="regvalue">Flags</span> </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Type </td>
    <td><span class="constant">REG_DWORD</span> </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Default </td>
    <td>0 </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>To disallow the extension whose CLSID is <span class="placeholder">clsid</span>, 
the dword of data for <span class="regvalue">Flags</span> must have either the 0x01 
or 0x10 bit set, and the following value </p>
<table class="Registry">
  <tr>
    <td>Key </td>
    <td><span class="regkey">HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Ext\Settings\{<span class="placeholder">clsid</span>}</span>
    <br>
    <span class="regkey">HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Ext\Settings\{<span class="placeholder">clsid</span>}</span>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Value </td>
    <td><span class="regvalue">Version</span> </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Type </td>
    <td><span class="constant">REG_SZ</span> </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>must have <span class="regsz">*</span> as its string data. Without both these 
settings, the extension is allowed. </p>
<p>These user settings have user-interface support through the “Manage add-ons” 
button in the Programs tab of the Internet Options. The same dialog is also reachable 
through the “Enable or disable Add-ons...” on the Manage Add-ons submenu of Internet 
Explorer’s Tools menu. The <span class="regkey">Settings</span> subkey does not 
seem to be formally documented, but it is acknowledged in a Knowledge Base article
<a target="_top" href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/883256">How to manage Internet 
Explorer add-ons in Windows XP Service Pack 2</a>. </p>
<h4>Uninstalled Add-Ons </h4>
<p>A slightly difficult problem occurs when users have disabled an add-on, which 
they subsequently uninstall and then reinstall. Should it still be disabled? It 
may be that the user really does mean to banish that particular extension forever, 
but it may also be that the user is now uninstalling and reinstalling in the hope 
of restoring the software to its pristine configuration. Though an uninstall program 
for an add-on may reasonably be expected to delete the registry key that listed 
the add-on as a browser extension, not all will know to delete the
<span class="regkey">Settings</span> subkey. After all, many add-ons pre-date it 
and Microsoft seems not to document it except as an afterthought (see the Knowledge 
Base article <a target="_top" href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/883256">How 
to manage Internet Explorer add-ons in Windows XP Service Pack 2</a>). </p>
<p>If an extension is disabled by preference but seems not to be installed, then 
this function treats the preference as stale. It deletes the extension’s
<span class="regkey">Settings</span> subkey and declares that the extension is allowed 
after all. </p>
<p>For this purpose, an extension is considered to installed if it is registered 
in <span class="regkey">HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT</span> or as a browser extension. The 
former means that <span class="regkey">HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\CLSID\{<span class="placeholder">clsid</span>}</span>, 
where <span class="placeholder">clsid</span> is the extension’s own CLSID or its 
redirection through a <span class="regkey">TreatAs</span> subkey, must have an
<span class="regkey">InprocServer32</span> or <span class="regkey">LocalServer32</span> 
subkey whose default value has no more than <span class="constant">MAX_PATH</span> 
characters of data. To be registered as a browser extension means that a key named
<span class="regkey">Software\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\Extensions\{<span class="placeholder">clsid</span>}</span> 
exists in either <span class="regkey">HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE</span> or
<span class="regkey">HKEY_CURRENT_USER</span>. </p>
<h2>Availability </h2>
<p>The <span class="function">CoInternetExtensionAllowed</span> function is exported 
as ordinal 103 from URLMON.DLL version 7.00 and higher. </p>
