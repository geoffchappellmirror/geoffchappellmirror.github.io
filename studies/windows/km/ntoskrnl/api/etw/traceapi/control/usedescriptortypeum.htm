<h1>Use Descriptor Type </h1>
<p>When given 0x1F as its <span class="argument">FunctionCode</span> argument, the
<span class="function"><a href="index.htm">NtTraceControl</a></span> function in 
version 10.0 and higher records that the given event provider is sufficiently modern 
that the <span class="member">Type</span> member in its <span class="struct">EVENT_DATA_DESCRIPTOR</span> 
structures is to be treated as meaningful. This <span class="member">Type</span> 
member is defined in space that used to be <span class="member">Reserved</span> 
but which will not certainly have been initialised by all event providers. Its use 
therefore needs to be explicitly enabled. </p>
<p>Microsoft’s name for this function code is not known. This note deals only with 
the function’s behaviour that is specific to this function code. The function’s 
general behaviour is here taken as assumed knowledge. </p>
<h2>Access </h2>
<p>Well-behaved user-mode software does not call <span class="function">NtTraceControl</span>. 
The documented user-mode API for reaching this functionality is
<span class="function">EventSetInformation</span>, which is exported by name from 
ADVAPI32.DLL in version 6.2 and higher, though only ever as a forward to the undocumened 
NTDLL function <span class="function">EtwEventSetInformation</span>. These higher-level 
functions vary their behaviour according to an <span class="argument">InformationClass</span> 
argument. The case that specifies whether to use the <span class="member">Type</span> 
in event data descriptors is <span class="constant">EventProviderUseDescriptorType</span> 
(3). Before version 10.0, this case is not supported. </p>
<p>The corresponding API for kernel-mode software is <span class="function">EtwSetInformation</span>. 
It is exported by name from the kernel in version 10.0 and higher. Microsoft declares 
it in WDM.H but does not document it. Kernel-mode access through
<span class="function">NtTraceControl</span> is not just unwanted but is even unexpected: 
the handle that is expected in the input (see below) has its access checked as if 
for a user-mode caller. </p>
<h2>Behaviour </h2>
<p>The expected input has at offset 0x00 a <span class="type">HANDLE</span> to the 
provider and at offset 0x08 a <span class="type">BOOLEAN</span> for whether to use 
types in descriptors. Though Microsoft surely has a structure for this, its name 
is not known. No output is expected. The function returns <span class="constant">
STATUS_INVALID_PARAMETER</span> if either of the following is true: </p>
<ul>
  <li>the input buffer does not provide exactly 0x10 bytes; </li>
  <li>an output buffer is given. </li>
</ul>
<p>The given <span class="type">HANDLE</span> is to be an Object Manager handle 
for an event registration object, i.e., an <span class="struct">
<a href="../../register/reg_entry/index.htm">ETW_REG_ENTRY</a></span>, that grants
<span class="constant">TRACELOG_REGISTER_GUIDS</span> access to user-mode callers. 
Failure to reference an event registration object from the given
<span class="type">HANDLE</span> is failure for the function. The whole of the function’s 
essential work is to set the given <span class="type">BOOLEAN</span> into the
<span class="member">UseDescriptorType</span> member of the referenced
<span class="struct">ETW_REG_ENTRY</span>. If the given <span class="type">BOOLEAN</span> 
is anything but <span class="constant">TRUE</span> or <span class="constant">FALSE</span>, 
the function fails, returning <span class="constant">STATUS_INVALID_PARAMETER</span>.
