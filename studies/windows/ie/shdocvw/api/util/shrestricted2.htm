<h1>SHRestricted2 </h1>
<p>This function gets the value of an Internet Explorer restriction. </p>
<h2>Declaration </h2>
<pre class="source">DWORD
SHRestricted2 (
    RESTRICTIONS2 rest,
    LPCTSTR url,
    DWORD reserved);</pre>
<!--webbot bot="Include" U-Include="../_include/aw.htm" TAG="BODY" startspan -->

<p>The function exists in ANSI and Unicode forms. </p>

<!--webbot bot="Include" i-checksum="40026" endspan -->
<h3>Parameters </h3>
<p>The <span class="argument">rest</span> argument selects the restriction whose 
value is wanted. The supported values in the <span class="enum">
<a href="restrictions2.htm">RESTRICTIONS2</a></span> enumeration are listed separately. 
(This name for the enumeration is invented, no record of Microsoft’s name being 
known.) </p>
<p>The <span class="argument">url</span> argument, if not NULL, supplies a URL to 
evaluate the restriction for, most notably with respect to the URL’s security zone.
</p>
<p>The <span class="argument">reserved</span> argument must be zero. </p>
<h3>Return Value </h3>
<p>The function returns the value of the selected restriction, else zero. </p>
<h2>Behaviour </h2>
<p>The Internet Explorer restrictions are defined as a set in the sense supported 
by the SHLWAPI function <span class="function">
<a href="../../../../shell/shlwapi/api/util/restrictions/lookup.htm">SHRestrictionLookup</a></span>. 
Each restriction is implemented as a registry value to be sought in either the
<span class="regkey">HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE</span> or <span class="regkey">HKEY_CURRENT_USER</span> 
branch, with precedence given to the former. Though many restrictions are booleans 
that specify whether a corresponding feature is restricted, typically as an administrative 
policy, the general scheme is that a restriction can evaluate to any DWORD, defaulting 
to zero. </p>
<p>The function fails if <span class="argument">reserved</span> is not zero or if
<span class="argument">rest</span> is unsupported. </p>
<p>When a URL is given, applicable restrictions (presently 0x50000002 to 0x50000008 
inclusive) are evaluated first with respect to the security zone, if any, that applies 
to the URL. The ordinary registry value for the restriction applies only if no URL 
is given or if querying for the URL policy permission does not succeed. </p>
<p>Part of the SHLWAPI support is that SHDOCVW provides memory for caching the values 
of the restrictions. It then depends on SHELL32 to be notified through its
<span class="function">
<a href="../../../../shell/shell32/api/util/shsettingschanged.htm">SHSettingsChanged</a></span> 
function if any restrictions have their values changed in the registry. SHELL32 
records the notification by incrementing a
<a href="../../../../shell/shlwapi/api/gcount/index.htm">global counter</a>, which 
is also a SHLWAPI feature. The <span class="function">SHRestricted2</span> function 
consults the counter (using the undocumented SHLWAPI function
<span class="function">SHGlobalCounterGetValue</span>) to learn whether any settings 
are known to have changed since the previous call to <span class="function">SHRestricted2</span>. 
If any have, the function resets its cached values of all restrictions before proceeding 
to ask SHLWAPI for the lookup. </p>
<h3>Old Behaviour </h3>
<p>To versions 4.71 and 4.72, any <span class="argument">rest</span> less than 0x50000001 
cannot be an Internet Explorer restriction but may be a shell restriction and is 
passed unchanged to the SHELL32 function <span class="function">
<a href="../../../../shell/shell32/api/util/shrestricted.htm">SHRestricted</a></span>. 
Also in these versions, SHDOCVW does its own caching and its own lookup. </p>
<h3>Shell Separation in Windows Vista </h3>
<p>For the version 6.0 from Windows Vista, the preceding explanation of behaviour 
remains true of the implementation in SHDOCVW, but this is not the implementation 
that is accessed by importing <span class="function">SHRestricted2</span> from SHDOCVW. 
The function is not-quite duplicated in a new DLL, named IEFRAME, and is exported 
from there. SHDOCVW forwards all import requests to the copy that is exported from 
IEFRAME. The implementation in SHDOCVW still gets a little use, but only internally 
(and even this may be due to oversight or to some difficulty in shedding it completely). 
In version 6.1, the implementation in SHDOCVW is eliminated entirely. </p>
<p>The preceding explanation of behaviour also is true of the implementation in 
IEFRAME, except that SHLWAPI is reduced just to providing the sense and meaning 
of what a restriction is and of how one is implemented. IEFRAME does not actually 
call the undocumented function <span class="function">SHRestrictionLookup</span> 
as implemented in SHLWAPI. Instead, IEFRAME has its own copy of the SHLWAPI code. 
Microsoft’s symbol files indicate that this copying of code from SHLWAPI is done 
at source-level, not by linking from a library. </p>
<p>Similar games apply to the global counter, but with more convolution. The SHLWAPI 
support for global counters was reworked for Windows Vista. The old functions are 
retired, but not because the functionality wasn’t wanted. There are new functions, 
arguably improving on the old, not that Microsoft cares to document them. Again, 
it should be stressed that the IEFRAME implementation of <span class="function">
SHRestricted2</span> does not get its global counters by calling any code in SHLWAPI. 
It gets them instead from a copy of the code. This time, however, the copy is not 
in IEFRAME: it is in another new DLL, named IERTUTIL, and IEFRAME imports its global-counter 
functionality from there (under the new name <span class="function">IEGlobalCounterGetValue</span>) 
rather than from SHLWAPI. </p>
<p>All this looks for all the world like a ruse to evade any accusation that IEFRAME 
calls undocumented SHLWAPI functions. Such calls would be problematic with respect 
to a legal settlement in which components of Internet Explorer are not to call undocumented 
functions in components of Windows. Just from its name, IEFRAME is surely an Internet 
Explorer component, and many might think SHLWAPI is just as surely a Windows component. 
Internet Explorer no longer calls SHLWAPI to help with the functionality of
<span class="function">SHRestricted2</span>. It just calls its own internal copy 
of the SHLWAPI code instead. Microsoft’s lawyers must be beside themselves with 
delight at their cleverness. </p>
<h4>Internet Explorer 7 </h4>
<p>This “separation” of Internet Explorer functionality from Windows seems to have 
been prepared some years in advance of Windows Vista. Starting with the version 
6.0 from Windows XP SP2 and from Windows Server 2003 SP1, including builds from 
the Internet Explorer 7 and 8 packages for Windows XP and Windows Server 2003, the 
SHDOCVW implementation of <span class="function">SHRestricted2</span> is aware that 
an IEFRAME implementation may be present from installation of Internet Explorer 
7 or 8. The exported function is not actually <span class="function">SHRestricted2W</span> 
itself but <span class="function">SHRestricted2W_IeframeProxy</span> (and similarly 
for the ANSI version). The proxy may have been intended to redirect the function 
to the IEFRAME implementation when IEFRAME is indeed present. As actually coded 
however, all the proxy does is save the address of the IEFRAME implementation before 
proceeding anyway to execute the rest of the SHDOCVW implementation. </p>
<h2>Availability </h2>
<p>The <span class="function">SHRestricted2</span> function is exported in ANSI 
and Unicode forms from: </p>
<ul>
  <li>SHDOCVW as ordinals 158 and 159 respectively in version 4.71 and higher;
  </li>
  <li>IEFRAME as ordinals 158 and 159 respectively in version 7.0 and higher.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>In version 6.0 from Windows Vista, and higher, SHDOCVW continues to export both 
forms of the function but only as forwards to IEFRAME. </p>
<!--webbot bot="Include" U-Include="../_include/undoc471.htm" TAG="BODY" startspan -->

<p>Though this function dates from as long ago as 1997, it was still not 
documented by Microsoft as late as the January 2007 edition of the Windows Vista 
Software Development Kit (SDK). </p>
