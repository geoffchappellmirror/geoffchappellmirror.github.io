<h1>Escape Sequences </h1>
<p>In both <a href="character.htm">character constants</a> and
<a href="string.htm">string constants</a>, each element in the sequence enclosed 
by quotes may be an <span class="definition">escape sequence</span> of 
source-set characters that together represent one byte in the constant. </p>
<p>Each escape sequence begins with a backslash. There are simple, octal and 
hexadecimal escape sequences. The simple sequences are each just a backslash and 
one character. Octal sequences may continue and hexadecimal sequences must. </p>

<p>To follow a backslash with any other character causes a warning (C4129) and 
the sequence evaluates to the first byte of the invalid character. </p>
<p>An octal escape sequence is a backslash followed by one, two or three 
consecutive octal digits. The number that these digits form in base 8 becomes 
the value of the execution-set character that is represented by the escape 
sequence. It is an error (C2022) if the constant is to be represented in terms 
of single-byte characters but the number formed by the octal digits is too big 
to fit in 8 bits. Otherwise, it is an error (C2188) if the number is too big to 
fit in 16 bits. An octal escape sequence followed by a decimal digit attracts a 
warning (C4125). </p>
<p>A hexadecimal escape sequence is a backslash followed by a lower-case x and 
then as many consecutive hexadecimal digits (in upper or lower case) as follow, 
but at least one. The number that these digits form in base 16 modulo 4G (i.e., 
truncated to 32 bits) becomes the value of the execution-set character that is 
represented by the escape sequence. It is an error (C2153) if there is not at 
least one hexadecimal digit to follow the backslash and x. It is an error 
(C2022) if the constant is to be represented in terms of single-byte characters 
but the number formed by the hexadecimal digits is too big to fit in 8 bits. 
Otherwise, it is an error (C2188) if the number is too big to fit in 16 bits. </p>
<h2>Translation Precedence </h2>
<p>Given the leading backslash, the remaining characters of the escape sequence 
are read (and the preceding notes on syntax are to be interpreted) as if 
trigraphs and line splices are already translated. </p>
