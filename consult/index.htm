  <h1>Consultation </h1>
  <p>You’re stuck. Your programmers are stuck. You have a problem that’s in the 
  too-hard basket. It has probably been there for a while and isn’t coming out any 
  time soon. But it must be faced now. If the problem has anything to do with Windows 
  programming, then I’m your guy. I thrill to the Windows programming that others 
  give up on. Give me your too-hard basket! </p>
  <p>If you’re a Windows programmer or you’re in the business of managing Windows 
  programmers, then you likely have the occasional thought that the process might 
  go easier if you could ask an expert. Perhaps you have an idea but aren’t sure 
  how practical it would be to do or whether it can even be done. Perhaps your programmers 
  tell you they’ll need six months just to have a prototype to show. Perhaps you 
  already got a great idea into production but now you’re learning of problems and 
  you’re wondering if they truly must be so hard to solve. Perhaps you and your 
  programmers wonder every day if there’s not a better (and less exposed) source 
  of advice than asking for free help at this or that Internet forum. Yet your need 
  is only ever occasional. It’s never even nearly enough to justify hiring someone 
  full-time, who anyway won’t be the most expert you can get and keep. So, consult!
  </p>
  <p>After all, if you think that your software development “pushes the boundaries 
  of operating system integration” (or some such, this being quoted from an ad by 
  Dropbox), then your problems are already what I happily spend all my working hours 
  solving. Who can you hope to find who’s better? </p>
  <p>Please read more of <a href="why.htm">why</a> I think you might do well to 
  consult me, and <a href="what.htm">what</a> sorts of things you might usefully 
  consult me about. Be aware, of course, that I do charge <a href="fees.htm">fees</a> 
  and I have <a href="terms.htm">terms</a>. </p>
