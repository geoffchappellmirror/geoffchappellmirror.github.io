<h1>SetBackgroundColor </h1>
<p>This method of the <span class="interface"><a href="index.htm">IListView</a></span> 
interface sets the background colour of a List-View control. </p>
<h2>Declaration </h2>
<pre class="source">HRESULT SetBackgroundColor (COLORREF clrBk);</pre>
<h3>Parameters </h3>
<p>The <span class="argument">clrBk</span> argument provides either: the 
background colour; or the value <span class="constant">CLR_NONE</span> 
(0xFFFFFFFF) if there is no background colour. </p>
<h3>Return Value </h3>
<!--webbot bot="Include" U-Include="../_include/hresult.htm" TAG="BODY" startspan -->

<p>The method returns zero for success, else an error code. </p>

<!--webbot bot="Include" i-checksum="37727" endspan -->
<!--webbot bot="Include" U-Include="_include/e_fail.htm" TAG="BODY" startspan -->

<p>Except where noted to the contrary, the error code is
<span class="constant">E_FAIL</span>. </p>

<!--webbot bot="Include" i-checksum="3188" endspan -->
<h2>Behaviour </h2>
<!--webbot bot="Include" U-Include="_include/createdestroy.htm" TAG="BODY" startspan -->

<p>The method fails, returning <span class="constant">E_UNEXPECTED</span>, if 
the List-View control has not yet received its <span class="message">WM_CREATE</span> 
message or has already received a <span class="message">WM_DESTROY</span> 
message.
</p>

<!--webbot bot="Include" i-checksum="20458" endspan -->
<p>If the List-View control is presently enabled, the request is acted on 
immediately, so that the given background colour becomes the current background 
colour. The given colour is <span class="constant">CLR_NONE</span> (0xFFFFFFFF) 
to clear the background colour, and is anything else to set a background colour. </p>
<p>By current background colour it is here meant the colour that the control is 
configured to use for its background when the background is next redrawn, 
whenever that turns out to be. Until then, the background as shown to the user 
may have an entirely different colour. This method does nothing to arrange that 
the background be repainted. </p>
<p>Whenever a List-View control is disabled, its current background colour is 
forced to <span class="constant">COLOR_BTNFACE</span>. If this method is called 
while the control is disabled, the requested setting or clearing of the 
background colour is deferred until the control is ever re-enabled, and the 
method returns success.
</p>
<h3>Setting the Background Colour </h3>
<p>Setting a background colour clears the <span class="constant">
LVS_EX_TRANSPARENTBKGND</span> 
extended style. If the new background colour already is the background colour, 
then the method succeeds. Otherwise, a solid brush is to be created for the new 
colour. Any solid brush for the old background colour is destroyed. Failure to 
create the new solid brush is failure for the method. Unless the control has the
<span class="constant">LVS_SHAREIMAGELISTS</span> style, the new background 
colour is also set for each of the image lists for normal icons, small icons and 
state images. Finally, the new background colour is also set for the column 
headers.
</p>
<h3>Clearing the Background Colour </h3>
<p>If the List-View already has no background colour, then the method succeeds. 
Otherwise, any solid brush for the old background colour is destroyed. Unless 
the control has the <span class="constant">LVS_SHAREIMAGELISTS</span> style, the 
background colour is also cleared from each of the image lists for normal icons, 
small icons and state images. Finally, the background colour is also cleared 
from the column headers. </p>
<h3>Implied Use </h3>
<p>These processes of setting and clearing the background colour can occur by 
implication. The following discussion simplifies very slightly by assuming that 
setting a background colour never fails. </p>
<p>The initial background colour for all List-View controls, as set when the 
control is created, is <span class="constant">COLOR_WINDOW</span>. </p>
<p>Whenever a List-View control is disabled, its background colour is set to
<span class="constant">COLOR_BTNFACE</span>. When a List-View control is created 
with the <span class="constant">WS_DISABLED</span> style, its background colour 
gets set twice: first to <span class="constant">COLOR_WINDOW</span> as the 
default; then to <span class="constant">COLOR_BTNFACE</span> by disabling the 
control. Whenever a List-View control is re-enabled, its background colour gets 
set again, either to update it (acting on the deferral noted above) else to 
restore it to whatever it was when the control was disabled. </p>
<p>While a List-View control uses a system colour for its background, receipt of 
a <span class="message">WM_SYSCOLORCHANGE</span> message causes the background 
colour to be set to whatever the applicable system colour now resolves to. A 
List-View control never stops regarding <span class="constant">COLOR_BTNFACE</span> 
as the applicable colour while the control is disabled, but it stops tracking
<span class="constant">COLOR_WINDOW</span> once this method is called or once 
the background colour is cleared through the implicit mechanism described next. </p>
<p>Setting the <span class="constant">LVS_EX_TRANSPARENTBKGND</span> extended 
style, e.g., through the <span class="method">SetExtendedStyle</span> method or
<span class="message">LVM_SETEXTENDEDLISTVIEWSTYLE</span> message, clears the 
background colour. </p>
<p>Microsoft perhaps thinks such interactions are all so obvious that they 
needn’t even be hinted at in the documentation. Yet there are practical 
consequences, both as warning and opportunity. If you set the 
transparent-background style and then allow the control to be disabled, you lose 
the style until you set it again, even if the control is eventually re-enabled. 
If you disable the control and then set the transparent-background style, you 
are able to give the disabled control an otherwise novel background (assuming 
that you manage the parent window), and when you re-enable the control, you get 
its background colour back. </p>
<h2>Availability </h2>
<p>The <span class="method">SetBackgroundColor</span> method of the
<span class="interface">IListView</span> interface is implemented by List-View 
controls in COMCTL32 versions 6.10 and higher. </p>
<p>In all versions from at least 3.50, the functionality of the
<span class="method">SetBackgroundColor</span> method is available through the 
windowing system, by sending the <span class="message">
<a href="../../messages/setbkcolor.htm">LVM_SETBKCOLOR</a></span> message. </p>
