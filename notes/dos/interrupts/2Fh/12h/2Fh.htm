  <h1>Interrupt 2Fh Function 122Fh </h1>
  <p>This function sets or clears the fake version number that
  <a href="../../21h/30h.htm"><span class="instruction">int 21h</span> function 30h</a> 
  may return in <span class="register">ax</span>. It acts non-trivially only in 
  version 4.0. </p>
  <h2>Parameters </h2>
  <p>The function uses registers for its input and output. As with any subfunction 
  of <span class="instruction">int 2Fh</span> function 12h, it also reads a word 
  from above the interrupt frame as if to access an argument. This particular subfunction, 
  however, does not interpret the word. </p>
  <h3>Input </h3>
  <table>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td><span class="register">ax</span> </td>
        <td>122Fh </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><span class="register">dx</span> </td>
        <td>version number, major version in low byte; <br>
        zero to use true version </td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
  <p>Given the kernel as implemented, this function has a well-defined effect if 
  and only if <span class="register">dx</span> is zero. It then clears whatever 
  fake version number the kernel may have adopted. Subsequent calls to
  <span class="instruction">int 21h</span> function 30h return the true version.
  </p>
  <p>What’s intended for non-zero <span class="register">dx</span> is unclear. The 
  behaviour depends on what programs and overlays the kernel has ever loaded. See 
  below for details. </p>
  <h3>Success (version 4.0) </h3>
  <p>The function’s simple implementation in version 4.0 must be counted as succeeding 
  trivially, but it does not explicitly indicate success or failure. As with any 
  subfunction of <span class="instruction">int 2Fh</span> function 12h that doesn’t 
  explicitly return anything in <span class="register">ax</span>, it corrupts
  <span class="register">ax</span> simply for having used it but not preserved it.
  </p>
  <table>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td><span class="register">ax</span> </td>
        <td>corrupt </td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
  <h3>Output (version 5.0 and higher) </h3>
  <p>Version 5.0 reduces the function to a placeholder. Whether its explicit clearing 
  of <span class="register">al</span> to zero is meant to indicate failure or just 
  success at doing nothing is not known. </p>
  <table>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td><span class="register">al</span> </td>
        <td>00h </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><span class="register">ah</span> </td>
        <td>corrupt </td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
  <h3>Failure (version 3.0 and higher) </h3>
  <p>To versions 3.0 and higher but before 4.0, this function is an unimplemented 
  subfunction of <span class="instruction">int 2Fh</span> function 12h. </p>
  <table>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td><span class="register">flags</span> </td>
        <td>carry flag set </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><span class="register">ax</span> </td>
        <td>error code </td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
  <p>Before version 3.0, the kernel does not implement <span class="instruction">
  int 2Fh</span> and has nothing to do with whatever happens from trying to call 
  this function. </p>
  <h2>Behaviour </h2>
  <p>Each loading of a program or overlay has the kernel consult a “special entries” 
  table for an entry that matches the file name. The entry provides both a non-zero 
  fake version number and a duration for its use. The duration specifies either 
  that the fake version affects some number of subsequent version queries or that 
  it lasts until the next process termination. </p>
  <h3>Clear </h3>
  <p>The fake version cannot be zero. Put another way, while the fake version is 
  zero, all version queries report the true DOS version. This is unambiguously what 
  is set up by this function when called with zero for <span class="register">dx</span>.
  </p>
  <p>The only known use of <span class="instruction">int 2Fh</span> function 122Fh 
  is with zero for <span class="register">dx</span>. This is done by the system 
  initialisation in IO.SYS after loading and initialising each device driver. Remember, 
  device drivers are overlays. Their return from their intialisation is not a process 
  termination. If a fake version was adopted for a device driver, it needs to be 
  cleared explicitly so that it can’t affect the next device driver. </p>
  <h3>Set </h3>
  <p>Calling the function with non-zero <span class="register">dx</span> might be 
  thought to set a fake version, perhaps with the implied duration of lasting until 
  the next process termination. It can have this effect, but it also can have no 
  effect at all. </p>
  <p>If there has never been a successful lookup or if the last was of the type 
  that has a count and this count has expired, then the kernel is not currently 
  faking its version number and this function does not make it start. Non-zero
  <span class="register">dx</span> has no effect on any subsequent version queries.
  </p>
  <p>If the last successful lookup set a count that has not yet expired, or if it 
  specified faking until the next process termination and no process has yet terminated, 
  then the kernel is faking its version number and non-zero
  <span class="register">dx</span> simply updates this fake version that the kernel 
  will report until it would anyway have stopped. </p>
  <p>If the last successful lookup was of the type that sets a fake version to apply 
  until the next process termination and a process has since terminated, however 
  long ago, then the kernel is not faking its version number but this function tells 
  it to start. Non-zero <span class="register">dx</span> will be reported as the 
  version number until the next process termination. </p>
