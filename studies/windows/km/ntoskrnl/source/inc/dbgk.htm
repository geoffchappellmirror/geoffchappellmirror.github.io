<h1>DBGK.H </h1>
<div class="Main">
  <p>The public symbol file NTKRPAMP.PDB for the original release of Windows 10 
  says nothing of any header named DBGK.H, yet one certainly does exist and surely 
  is included by source files that contribute to the kernel’s binary code. Whether 
  it’s included by the separate source file <a href="../ntsym.htm">ntsym.c</a> whose 
  compilation merges type information into the public symbols is not known, but 
  if it is included it’s to no effect. Indeed, no type information attributed to 
  DBGK.H shows in any of the symbol files from the downloadable package of public 
  symbols for the original Windows 10. </p>
  <p>Type information from a DBGK.H for Windows 10 shows instead in a statically 
  linked library named CLFSMGMT.LIB which Microsoft publishes with the Software 
  Development Kit (SDK). This library archives an object file that was produced 
  as a side-effect of creating a pre-compiled header. it plausibly is a complete 
  record of user-defined types in DBGK.H because much of the point to a pre-compiled 
  header is that it carries the definitions of all types that
  <span class="emphasis">might</span> be used in any other compilation (with the 
  same options and macro definitions). Where this library got its DBGK.H from is
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    d:\th.public.fre\internal\minwin\priv_sdk\inc\ntos
  </blockquote>
  <p>Names and line numbers of user-defined types from this header are tablulated 
  below. There are only two, not counting an anonymous sub-type. One has its definition 
  duplicated into two headers that Microsoft published with the Windows Driver Kit 
  (WDK) for Windows 10 in the original and Version 1511 editions only. The line 
  numbers on the left are deduced from type information in the library. Those on 
  the right are from the (accidentally) published headers. </p>
  <table class="LineNumbers">
    <colgroup>

      <col class="LineNumber" span="2">
    </colgroup>
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>Line Number </th>

        <th>NTOSIFS.H </th>
        <th>NTOSP.H </th>
      </tr>

    <tbody>
      <tr>

        <td>3168 </td>
        <td>53251 </td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
  <p>In case it’s not clear, let it be stressed that no header named DBGK.H is known 
  from any WDK for any Windows version or, earlier, from any Device Driver Kit (DDK). 
  For some measure of its obscurity, consider that asking Google today, 7th February 
  2023, for what’s known on the Internet about “DBGK_LIVEDUMP_FLAGS” gets that the 
  search “did not match any documents.” </p>
  <p>The <span class="struct">DEBUG_OBJECT</span> is less obscure, but apparently 
  only for dating from long enough ago that it (and the header, by the way) are 
  known to many “reverse engineers” from source code that Microsoft distributed 
  as the Windows Research Kernel (WRK) under conditions that can’t reasonably be 
  counted as publication. As the kernel-mode structure that
  <span class="emphasis">is</span> the debug object such as can be created from 
  user mode through the <span class="function">NtCreateDebugObject</span> function, 
  the <span class="struct">DEBUG_OBJECT</span> is not without importance. </p>
