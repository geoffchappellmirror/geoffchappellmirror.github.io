<h1>SetupLowFolderPath </h1>
<p>Sets low integrity for a specified folder, creating the folder if necessary.
</p>
<h2>Declaration </h2>
<pre class="source">HRESULT SetupLowFolderPath (PCWSTR pszFolder);</pre>
<h3>Parameters </h3>
<p>The <span class="argument">pszFolder</span> argument provides the address of 
a path to the folder. </p>
<h3>Return Value </h3>
<!--webbot bot="Include" U-Include="../_include/hresult.htm" TAG="BODY" startspan -->

<p>The function returns zero for success, else an error code. </p>

<!--webbot bot="Include" i-checksum="1551" endspan -->
<h2>Behaviour </h2>
<p>The function succeeds trivially if the folder is remote, meaning specifically 
that the volume mount point has the drive type <span class="constant">DRIVE_REMOTE</span>. 
Otherwise, the function tries to set low integrity for the folder. If access is 
denied, the function takes full control of the folder and then retries to set low 
integrity. </p>
<p>If not running on Windows Vista or higher, setting low integrity for the folder 
will not be possible, and the function fails (returning <span class="constant">S_FALSE</span>). 
The function opens the folder, asking for <span class="constant">WRITE_OWNER</span> 
and <span class="constant">STANDARD_RIGHTS_WRITE</span> access rights. If this fails 
because the folder does not exist, the function creates the folder, including to 
create any folders needed along the path (see <span class="function">SHCreateDirectory</span>). 
If this succeeds, or if it fails because the folder meanwhile came into existence 
by other means, the function tries again to open the folder. If the folder cannot 
be opened, the function fails. Given that the folder (or file) has been opened, 
the function sets low integrity for it by calling the <span class="function">
<a href="../util/setfilehandleintegritylevel.htm">SetFileHandleIntegrityLevel</a></span> 
function with the particular SID that is represented by LW in the Security Descriptor 
Definition Language. </p>
<p>Note that although the function’s name does not suggest it is intended for use 
on a file, the preceding algorithm does not insist that <span class="argument">pszFolder</span> 
be the path to a folder rather than a file. The function can be used to set low 
integrity for a file that already exists, but with the side-effect that if the file 
doesn’t exist, it will get created as a directory. </p>
<p>Taking full control of the folder is a matter of adding an access-allowed ACE 
for the current process’s user account. The new ACE is inheritable both by files 
and subfolders, and grants <span class="constant">FILE_ALL_ACCESS</span> rights. 
Note that the function does not undo this after setting low integrity: full access 
is a possible side-effect of this function. A quirk that may matter to someone is 
that if the function does try to take full control, it works with a copy of the 
given path and thus picks up a limit of <span class="constant">MAX_PATH</span> characters.
</p>
<h3>Old Behaviour </h3>
<p>Version 7.0 has no provision for taking full control in order to retry setting 
low integrity. Also, version 7.0 creates the folder using the standard Windows API 
function <span class="function">CreateDirectory</span>, and thus does not create 
intermediate folders. It also does not allow that the folder may meanwhile have 
got created by other hands. </p>
<h2>Availability </h2>
<p>The <span class="function">SetupLowFolderPath</span> function is exported from 
IERTUTIL as ordinal 38 in version 7.0 and higher. </p>
