  <h1>Desktop Icon for Default Web Browser </h1>
  <p>Most Windows users are by now familiar with Microsoft’s provisions for making 
  Internet Explorer’s presence in Windows less apparent and for emphasising the 
  user’s preference for a different web browser. Critical attention, even extending 
  to legal proceeedings, has tended to focus on an Internet Explorer icon which 
  Windows used to place on the desktop by default (and still does, once you have 
  chosen the Classic Start Menu). This icon is especially notable for having no 
  shortcut overlay, so that it looks more fundamental than most, as if it’s an entirely 
  natural addition to the desktop icons for system folders such as the Computer, 
  Control Panel or Network. </p>
  <p>Of course, no browser, seen just as one of many competing web-browser applications, 
  is any sort of system resource. However, an abstracted notion of access to the 
  Internet, without caring which particular web browser happens to be installed 
  or preferred, arguably is a system resource and might usefully be represented 
  by a desktop icon that looks like a system object. It could look like this:
  </p>
  <img alt="Windows Vista Desktop Icons (Internet Explorer)" src="_images/desktopicons-ie.jpg" width="525" height="175">
  <p>or this: </p>
  <img alt="Windows Vista Desktop Icons (Firefox)" src="_images/desktopicons-firefox.jpg" width="525" height="175">
  <p>depending on your choice of default web browser. </p>
  <p>Exactly such a system object already exists. Indeed, you very likely have used 
  it at least once: when you first start Windows, the Start Menu typically has at 
  its top a shortcut to this abstracted Internet object. Choose a different browser 
  as the default and this shortcut changes too. You can drag this shortcut to the 
  desktop, but what results is still a shortcut to the underlying object. If you 
  want the Internet on the desktop as a system object, as in the pictures, you can 
  have it just by adding one registry key: </p>
  <table class="Registry">
    <tr>
      <td>Key: </td>
      <td><span class="regkey">HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\Desktop\NameSpace</span>
      <br>
      <span class="regkey">HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\Desktop\NameSpace</span>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Subkey: </td>
      <td><span class="regkey">{2559A1F4-21D7-11D4-BDAF-00C04F60B9F0}</span>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  <p>Adding to the first of the keys, under <span class="regkey">HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE</span>, 
  is typically easier because the key exists already. However, it has the effect 
  of adding the icon to the desktop for all users. This may be what you want, but 
  if not, add to the <span class="regkey">HKEY_CURRENT_USER</span> branch even though 
  you may have to build the tree before you can add the subkey. </p>
  <p>After adding the key (and possibly also if you change your default browser, 
  depending on how you do it), you will typically have to refresh the desktop to 
  get the key noticed or the icon redrawn. Just click on the desktop and press F5.
  </p>
  <h2>Explanation </h2>
  <p>The numbers in curly braces are the class ID (CLSID) for the Internet object. 
  That you can add it to the desktop’s namespace and have it work immediately is 
  because Windows is installed with a set of suitable registry entries for this 
  class ID. These registry entries rely on other types of object which are supported 
  by executable code. For it all to work, you need at least SHDOCVW.DLL version 
  5.00 and SHELL32.DLL version 6.00. In practice, then, you need Windows XP or higher.
  </p>
  <p>The essential SHELL32 support is for the <span class="class">
  <a href="../../../studies/windows/shell/shell32/classes/clientextracticon.htm">
  ClientExtractIcon</a></span> and <span class="class">
  <a href="../../../studies/windows/shell/shell32/api/assocelem/client.htm">AssocClientElement</a></span> 
  classes (neither of which is documented). The latter provides access to the registry 
  key where competing browsers are configured. Of particular importance is the determination 
  of the default browser. It is found from the default value of the following registry 
  keys (in decreasing order of precedence): </p>
  <table class="Registry">
    <tr>
      <td>Key: </td>
      <td><span class="regkey">HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Clients\StartMenuInternet</span>
      <br>
      <span class="regkey">HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Clients\StartMenuInternet</span>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Value: </td>
      <td>default </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Type: </td>
      <td><span class="constant">REG_SZ</span> </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  <p>Provided that the <span class="constant">REG_SZ</span> data is non-empty (and 
  does not exceed 80 characters), it names the default <span class="regkey">StartMenuInternet</span> 
  client, i.e., the default web browser. What is then knowable about the default 
  browser all comes from subkeys and values in the one registry key: </p>
  <table class="Registry">
    <tr>
      <td>Key: </td>
      <td><span class="regkey">HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Clients\StartMenuInternet\<span class="placeholder">DefaultBrowser</span></span>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  <p>Beware that the behaviour of the Internet icon (and of the equivalent Start 
  Menu shortcut) is only as good as the information that the browser’s setup program 
  has recorded in this key. Some manufacturers are suprisingly unimaginative in 
  their interpretation of Microsoft’s admittedly perfunctory documentation of what 
  to put in this key. For instance, though Microsoft documents that the command 
  to start the browser needs to be the default value of a subkey named
  <span class="regkey">shell\open\command</span>, there is no explicit direction 
  that verbs other than “open” can be meaningful. Unless the browser supplies a 
  command under <span class="regkey">shell\properties\command</span>, the context 
  menu for the icon (or Start Menu shortcut) defaults to showing Internet Properties, 
  as if for Internet Explorer. </p>
  <p>The <span class="class">ClientExtractIcon</span> class can expose any type 
  of association element as a shell extension. To specify an association with the 
  default web browser as a type of client program requires more configuration. For 
  this configuration to come through registry settings, the class is created as 
  an SHDOCVW <a href="../../../studies/windows/ie/shdocvw/classes/instance.htm">
  instance class</a>. This is why the <span class="regkey">CLSID</span> key for 
  the Internet object has SHDOCVW.DLL as its <span class="regkey">InProcServer32</span>. 
  This has a curious implication, given that SHDOCVW is the essence of Internet 
  Explorer in versions before Windows Vista: to start a non-Microsoft web browser 
  from the Internet shortcut on the Start Menu, you actually depend on running a 
  little bit of Internet Explorer. </p>
  <p>An instance class provides a sort of CLSID redirection. What you actually get 
  when creating an instance is specified in the <span class="regkey">Instance</span> 
  subkey for the CLSID. In particular, the following value specifies that the instance 
  class for the Internet object is actually to be a <span class="class">ClientExtractIcon</span>:
  </p>
  <table class="Registry">
    <tr>
      <td>Key: </td>
      <td><span class="regkey">HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\CLSID\{2559a1f4-21d7-11d4-bdaf-00c04f60b9f0}\Instance</span>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Value: </td>
      <td><span class="regvalue">CLSID</span> </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Type: </td>
      <td><span class="constant">REG_SZ</span> </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Data: </td>
      <td><span class="clsid">{25585dc7-4da0-438d-ad04-e42c8d2d64b9}</span> </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  <p>The data is the string representation of <span class="constant">CLSID_ClientExtractIcon</span>. 
  How the <span class="class">ClientExtractIcon</span> class is to be configured 
  comes from properties in a deeper subkey named <span class="regkey">InitPropertyBag</span>. 
  That it should expose an <span class="class">AssocClientElement</span> class is 
  because the data for the value </p>
  <table class="Registry">
    <tr>
      <td>Key: </td>
      <td><span class="regkey">HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\CLSID\{2559a1f4-21d7-11d4-bdaf-00c04f60b9f0}\Instance\InitPropertyBag</span>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Value: </td>
      <td><span class="regvalue">Element</span> </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Type: </td>
      <td><span class="constant">REG_SZ</span> </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Data: </td>
      <td><span class="clsid">{3c81e7fa-1f3b-464a-a350-114a25beb2a2}</span> </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  <p>is <span class="constant">CLSID_AssocClientElement</span>. The particular type 
  of client to be modelled by the <span class="class">AssocClientElement</span> 
  is specified through the <span class="regvalue">InitString</span> value: </p>
  <table class="Registry">
    <tr>
      <td>Key: </td>
      <td><span class="regkey">HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\CLSID\{2559a1f4-21d7-11d4-bdaf-00c04f60b9f0}\Instance\InitPropertyBag</span>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Value: </td>
      <td><span class="regvalue">InitString</span> </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Type: </td>
      <td><span class="constant">REG_SZ</span> </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Data: </td>
      <td><span class="regsz">StartMenuInternet</span> </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  <p>There are more settings involved, both to configure the <span class="class">
  ClientExtractIcon</span> class and for the object to have an icon and context 
  menu, but the settings shown above are the ones that join the dots for the selection 
  of a default web browser. </p>
  <p>Note that the scheme works for other types of client program. For instance, 
  if you wanted a desktop icon for the default media player, you could generate 
  a new CLSID to take the place of <span class="regkey">{2559A1F4-21D7-11D4-BDAF-00C04F60B9F0}</span>, 
  and then reproduce all the subkeys and values but set <span class="regsz">Media</span> 
  as the data for the <span class="regvalue">InitString</span> value. </p>
  <h2>E-Mail </h2>
  <p>In the particular case of e-mail readers, there is a set of subkeys and values 
  defined already. So, if you want a desktop icon to represent your default e-mail 
  reader, just add to the desktop’s namespace as if for the default web browser 
  but change the CLSID to <span class="clsid">{2559A1F5-21D7-11D4-BDAF-00C04F60B9F0}</span>.
