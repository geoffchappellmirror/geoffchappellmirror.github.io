  <h1>RTL_DRIVE_LETTER_CURDIR </h1>
  <p>The <span class="struct">RTL_DRIVE_LETTER_CURDIR</span> structure (formally
  <span class="struct">_RTL_DRIVE_LETTER_CURDIR</span>) is a small structure that 
  is presently thought to be defined in all Windows versions but not used in any.
  </p>
  <p>From the name, the intended purpose is for keeping a current directory for 
  each drive (letter). This is consistent with the two known references to this 
  structure in definitions of other structures. </p>
  <p>The better known, e.g., from public symbol files for the kernel, is that the
  <span class="struct"><a href="rtl_user_process_parameters.htm">RTL_USER_PROCESS_PARAMETERS</a></span> 
  has an <span class="struct">RTL_DRIVE_LETTER_CURDIR</span> array as a member named
  <span class="member">CurrentDirectores</span>. Yes, this misspelling is Microsoft’s 
  and there are 32 in the array, not 26. Nesting even one <span class="struct">RTL_DRIVE_LETTER_CURDIR</span> 
  in the <span class="struct">RTL_USER_PROCESS_PARAMETERS</span> means that the 
  former’s definition must be available for the latter’s—and the latter is in turn 
  well known for being pointed to from the <span class="struct">
  <a href="peb/index.htm">PEB</a></span>. Public symbols for the kernel, starting 
  with Windows 8, confirm that the <span class="struct">RTL_DRIVE_LETTER_CURDIR</span> 
  is defined in a header named <a href="../../../source/inc/pebteb.htm">pebteb.h</a>. 
  But no code is (yet) known that uses this array—not in the kernel or NTDLL or 
  even further afield, in any version. </p>
  <p>Much less well known is that a structure named <span class="struct">
  <a href="../nturtl/rtl_perthread_curdir.htm">RTL_PERTHREAD_CURDIR</a></span> has 
  a member named <span class="member">CurrentDirectories</span> which is defined 
  as pointing to an <span class="struct">RTL_DRIVE_LETTER_CURDIR</span> (or, surely, 
  to an array of them). All known versions of 32-bit Windows have code that prepares 
  an <span class="struct">RTL_PERTHREAD_CURDIR</span> but no code is yet known that 
  initialises the <span class="member">CurrentDirectories</span> pointer to anything 
  but <span class="constant">NULL</span>. All known versions of Windows, both 32-bit 
  and 64-bit, have code that will read an <span class="struct">RTL_PERTHREAD_CURDIR</span> 
  (from the <span class="member">SubSystemTib</span> pointer in the
  <span class="struct">NT_TIB</span> at the start of a <span class="struct">
  <a href="teb/index.htm">TEB</a></span>), but no code is yet known that reads the
  <span class="member">CurrentDirectories</span>. </p>
  <p>Thus is the <span class="struct">RTL_DRIVE_LETTER_CURDIR</span> thought to 
  be defined in all Windows versions but not used in any. That a structure is still 
  defined without having ever been used is certainly not impossible, but the waste 
  of it suggests that more research is required. </p>
  <h2>Layout </h2>
  <p>The <span class="struct">RTL_DRIVE_LETTER_CURDIR</span> is 0x10 and 0x18 bytes 
  in 32-bit and 64-bit Windows, respectively, in all known versions. The structure’s 
  name and the names and definitions of its members are known from public symbol 
  files for the kernel, starting from Windows 2000 SP3. That the definitions apply 
  also to earlier versions is a guess based on nothing more than the apparent reservation 
  of the right amount of space in the <span class="struct">RTL_USER_PROCESS_PARAMETERS</span> 
  all the way back to version 3.10. </p>

  <p>What any of these members mean—or were ever meant to mean—is not known, no 
  code having yet been found that accesses the structure whether in the
  <span class="member">CurrentDirectores</span> array or through the
  <span class="member">CurrentDirectories</span> pointer. </p>
