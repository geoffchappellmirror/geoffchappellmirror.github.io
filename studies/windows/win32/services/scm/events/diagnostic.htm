<h1>Diagnostic Provider for SERVICES.EXE </h1>
<p>Something new for SERVICES.EXE in Windows Vista is an event provider that writes 
analytic events: </p>
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>Provider Name: </td>
    <td>Microsoft-Windows-Services </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Provider GUID: </td>
    <td>{0063715B-EEDA-4007-9429-AD526F62696E} </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Symbolic Name for GUID: </td>
    <td><span class="symbol">MS_Services_Provider</span> </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>This provider is described in an instrumentation manifest, which Microsoft supplies 
as an <span class="tag">&lt;instrumentation&gt;</span> block within the manifest that 
represents SERVICES.EXE as an assembly. Refer to the separate note about
<a href="../versions.htm">SERVICES Versions</a> for the name and location. The instrumentation 
manifest is also compiled into the SERVICES resources, as WEVT_TEMPLATE. </p>
<h2>Default Channel </h2>
<p>The registry is installed with the Microsoft-Windows-Services provider already 
configured as a publisher to the following log, which the instrumentation manifest 
specifies as the default channel: </p>
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>Channel: </td>
    <td>Microsoft-Windows-Services/Diagnostic </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Session: </td>
    <td>Eventlog-Microsoft-Windows-Services-Diagnostic </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Event Viewer: </td>
    <td>Applications and Services Logs; <br>
    Microsoft Windows Services Performance Diagnostic Provider; <br>
    Diagnostic </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>The name given for the session is how it appears in the Reliability and Performance 
Monitor among the Event Trace Sessions. The channel is the name needed for WEVTUTIL.
<span class="draft">The Event Viewer lists the session among the Applications and 
Services Logs, as the Diagnostic channel of the Microsoft Windows Services Performance 
Diagnostic Provider. </span></p>
<h3>Permissions </h3>
<p>As with other direct channels (i.e., for analytic and debug events), this one 
is not ordinarily enabled. Unlike most others, this one is somewhat difficult to 
enable. Indeed, the ordinary configuration does not permit this log to be enabled 
through the Event Viewer without causing an error to be reported to the System log. 
The event ID is 30, with Eventlog as the source: </p>
<blockquote>
  The event logging service encountered an error (5) while enabling publisher {0063715B-EEDA-4007-9429-AD526F62696E} 
  to channel Microsoft-Windows-Services/Diagnostic. This doesn&#39;t affect operation 
  of the channel, but does affect the ability for the publisher to raise events 
  to the channel. One common cause for this error is that Provider is using ETW 
  Provider Security and has not granted enable permissions to the Eventlog service 
  entity.</blockquote>
<p>The text, though arguably cryptic, is correct. The Microsoft-Windows-Services 
provider is one of relatively few for which the ordinary configuration of Windows 
specifies a security descriptor. Only the SYSTEM account and the Administrators 
group are permitted any access. Though the Event Viewer runs with administrative 
privilege, the system call that would enable the Microsoft-Windows-Services provider 
for the Microsoft-Windows-Services/Diagnostic log is actually made by the Eventlog 
service, executing as WEVTSVC.DLL in a SVCHOST.EXE process that runs from the LOCAL 
SERVICE account. To enable this log without an error, you must first add suitable 
permissions for the LOCAL SERVICE account. </p>
<p>Permissions for the Microsoft-Windows-Services provider are set through the registry:
</p>
<table class="Registry">
  <tr>
    <td>Key: </td>
    <td><span class="regkey">HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\WMI\Security</span>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Value: </td>
    <td><span class="regvalue">0063715b-eeda-4007-9429-ad526f62696e</span> </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Type: </td>
    <td><span class="constant">REG_BINARY</span> </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>The binary data is the security descriptor for the provider. You could edit this 
by hand, but there actually is user-interface support, albeit in a round-about way. 
Though Windows does not come with a program for operating on security for arbitrary 
providers and sessions, the Reliability and Performance Monitor allows for working 
with security for providers and sessions that are started already (whether or not 
enabled) or are registered to start automatically when Windows next starts. The 
trick, then, begins with getting the Reliabilty and Performance Monitor to list 
the Microsoft-Windows-Services provider. </p>
<p>Start the Reliability and Performance Monitor. Expand the tree on the left to 
expose Event Trace Sessions. Click on that and then start creating a Data Collector 
Set. Give it some name such as Temporary, and elect to create manually. Ask to Add 
a provider and when the large list of known providers appears, select Microsoft-Windows-Services 
and then Finish. Now get Properties for your new data collector set. The Trace Providers 
tab will allow you to set security for the Microsoft-Windows-Services provider through 
a standard user interface. When done, click OK and then delete the Temporary data 
collector set. Thereafter, you can enable the Microsoft-Windows-Services/Diagnostic 
log through the Event Viewer without causing an error to appear in the System log.
</p>
<h2>WDI Context Provider </h2>
<p>Microsoft-Windows-Services is a context provider for the
<a href="../../../../../../notes/windows/wdi/index.htm">Windows Diagnostic Infrastructure</a> (WDI). This 
means that a selection of the possible events gets written to the DiagLog and WdiContextLog 
sessions. Both are configured in the registry as auto-loggers, and are ordinarily 
configured to start automatically. The DiagLog is a real-time log, but the WdiContextLog 
streams to a file, and the backups from previous Windows sessions can be loaded 
into the Event Viewer for inspection. </p>
<p>Events for this log are selected both by the usual mechanism, of level and keyword, 
and also by the WDI mechanism of enabling the provider only during an applicable 
scenario. Since all the possible events from Microsoft-Windows-Services happen to 
have the same level and keyword, only the scenarios matter. There are four applicable 
scenarios: </p>
<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Start Event </th>
    <th>End Event </th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>6001 (<span class="symbol">WIDiagEvt_ShutdownDiagnostics_Start</span>)
    <br>
    from Microsoft-Windows-Wininit </td>
    <td>48 (<span class="symbol">POP_ETW_EVENT_GRACEFULSHUTDOWN_STOP</span>) <br>
    from Microsoft-Windows-Kernel-Power </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>6001 (<span class="symbol">WLDiagEvt_ShutdownDiagnostics_Start</span>)
    <br>
    from Microsoft-Windows-Winlogon </td>
    <td>48 (<span class="symbol">POP_ETW_EVENT_GRACEFULSHUTDOWN_STOP</span>) <br>
    from Microsoft-Windows-Kernel-Power </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>501 (<span class="symbol">KMBootEvt_SystemBoot_Start</span>) <br>
    from Microsoft-Windows-Kernel-BootDiagnostics </td>
    <td>5007 (<span class="symbol">WLDiagEvt_SystemBootScenario_Stop</span>) <br>
    from Microsoft-Windows-Winlogon </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>5001 (<span class="symbol">WLDiagEvt_UserBootScenario_Start</span>) <br>
    from Microsoft-Windows-Winlogon </td>
    <td>5002 (<span class="symbol">WLDiagEvt_UserBootScenario_Stop</span>) <br>
    from Microsoft-Windows-Winlogon </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>Between the start and end events from these other event providers, the kernel 
enables Microsoft-Windows-Services so that all events from the Microsoft-Windows-Services 
provider are logged to WDI. </p>
<h2>Events </h2>
<p>There are presently just a handful of possible event IDs, but the facility is 
surely meant to expand. Unfortunately, none of the <span class="keyword">event</span> 
definitions in the manifest supply formatted text, e.g., through a
<span class="keyword">message</span> attribute, and so the Event Viewer falls back 
to the following distinctly unhelpful description: </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The description for Event ID <span class="placeholder">id</span> from source 
  Microsoft-Windows-Services cannot be found. Either the component that raises the 
  event is not installed on your local computer or the installation is corrupted. 
  You can install or repair the component on the local computer. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Still, the manifest is useful because it labels the event data. All these events 
have win:Informational (4) as the level and 0x8000000000000000 as the keyword. The 
manifest has no plain-language representation of this keyword. </p>
