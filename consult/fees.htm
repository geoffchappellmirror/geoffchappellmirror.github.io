  <h1>Consulting Fees </h1>
  <p>Look around this website. I have a long history of knowing my areas of interest 
  in Windows better than anyone else who has published on them, of correcting what 
  Microsoft writes, and of documenting what Microsoft doesn’t. You will rarely see 
  anywhere such a commitment to precision and reliability. Get this working for 
  you when your own Windows programmers are stuck or you’d prefer to have a Windows 
  expert do the programming from the outset. </p>
  <p>This fee schedule applies from 1st January 2023. All fees are denominated in 
  U.S. dollars. </p>
  <p>I mean that <span class="highlight">my rates are roughly those of an experienced 
  but non-expert accountant or lawyer</span>. If you don’t like them, take them 
  merely as a guide and make me an offer. I have always been open to working at 
  much reduced rates, and even for free, if you present an interesting problem or 
  if you compromise on intellectual-property rights, e.g., by letting me publish 
  results to my own website (after a time, perhaps) or by agreeing to put my name 
  to anything you publish from the work. Or just look like you’re not going to burden 
  me with overheads. </p>
  <p>To get your consultation under way, write to
  <a href="mailto:consult@geoffchappell.com?subject=Thinking To Consult You">consult@geoffchappell.com</a>. 
  Please take care to introduce yourself and set out your problem’s details as carefully 
  as you yet know them. Please also bear in mind that I do have
  <a href="terms.htm">terms</a>. I mean them to be as accommodating as can be within 
  my business model of consultation as funding for research. If you need different 
  terms, please say so from the outset so that I know to think what might be done 
  to meet your concerns instead of wasting your time and mine by hoping you’ll explain 
  yourself. </p>
  <h2>Projects and Reports </h2>
  <p><span class="highlight">The rate for programming projects and investigative 
  reports is $2,500 daily and $12,000 weekly, based on 8-hour days and 5-day weeks.</span> 
  Partial days and weeks are billed as whole. Excess hours for long days and excess 
  days for long weeks are billed pro rata. </p>
  <h2>Casual Work </h2>
  <p>The standard rate for small work items such as crash-dump analyses and casual 
  questions about undocumented or under-documented Windows API functions is $400 
  per hour. A minimum of one hour applies. After that, time is counted in decimal 
  parts of hours. </p>
  <p>This rate is my highest, though it is arguably nowhere near to high enough, 
  because experience shows that this sort of work often takes more time to negotiate 
  than to do. The following two discounts are available in circumstances that suggest 
  you will use much less of my un-billable time. </p>
  <h3>Advance Purchase </h3>
  <p>Work that would usually count as casual can be obtained for $330 per hour if 
  you purchase 40 or more hours in advance to use or lose within six months. </p>
  <h3>Bulk Discount </h3>
  <p>This discount rate of <span class="highlight">$330 per hour</span> is also 
  available if you establish a reasonable expectation of providing well-organised 
  problems for at least 40 hours per month over six months or more. </p>
  <h2>Scheduling </h2>
  <p>Please note that although I respond quickly to commercial problems, especially 
  for emergencies, my ability to schedule whole days, let alone weeks, is sometimes 
  limited. The longer the engagement, the more you should expect a delay before 
  I can arrange your work around other work. To secure my attention or availability, 
  consider a retainer. </p>
  <h2>Estimates </h2>
  <p>I will try to quote a price for a well-specified self-contained problem. I 
  will not engage in refining your specification as part of a quote. I will not 
  accept responsibility for time that depends on other people, e.g., to gather information 
  or agree on interfaces. </p>
  <p>Experience has shown that problems are often brought to me only because they 
  have already shown a capacity to surprise even the brightest of my clients’ programmers. 
  For such problems, it is rarely sensible to estimate even to within a factor of 
  two. More typical is that I can be no less vague than to estimate whether your 
  work will take me a few hours, a few days or a few weeks. </p>
  <p>If your project looks like it would need my time for months, then although 
  I don’t dismiss it, I likely can’t take it on unless it can clearly be broken 
  into manageable pieces. Please remember that I am a consultant not a contractor. 
  Anyway, much of the point to consulting me is that even if you have already spent 
  months on your project and not got very far, I look at it differently and see 
  how to do it in weeks, not months. This is the happy spot! </p>
  <h2>Contracting and Employment </h2>
  <p>Of course, I do sometimes wonder about long-term contracting and full-time 
  employment. If you want the services of a Windows expert full-time, I’m open to 
  offers. </p>
