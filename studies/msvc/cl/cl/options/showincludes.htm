<h1>CL /showIncludes </h1>
<h2>Syntax </h2>
<p>This option has no arguments. It is <span class="switch">/showIncludes</span> 
only. </p>
<h3>Relations </h3>
<p>The <span class="switch">/showIncludes</span> option has no syntactical relations 
with other options. </p>
<p>It passes unchanged to the front-end C and C++ compilers (C1 and C1XX). </p>
<h2>Behaviour </h2>
<p>The only action of this option is to have the front-end compiler report inclusion 
of source files. Each report is issued to standard error in the form </p>
<pre class="output">Note: including file: <span class="placeholder">filename</span></pre>
<p>The <span class="placeholder">filename</span> is indented by one space for each 
level of nested inclusion. </p>
<p>At the time of the note, the named file has been opened and some amount has been 
read but not yet put to preprocessing. That said, the note is not the very first 
action after the inclusion has been successfully set up. First, a
<span class="directive">#line</span> directive naming the included file is written 
as preprocessor output, if such output is enabled (as by <span class="switch">
<a href="e.htm">/E</a></span> or <span class="switch"><a href="p.htm">/P</a></span>) 
but line re-numbering is not suppressed (as by <span class="switch">
<a href="ep.htm">/EP</a></span>). Second, the first few bytes read from the included 
file are checked for Unicode signatures (as for warning
<a href="../../c1xx/warnings/c4821.htm">C4821</a>). </p>
<p>Where an inclusion refers to a file that has been loaded previously and was found 
to contain a <span class="directive">#pragma once</span> directive, the compiler 
remembers not to open the file again and therefore does not issue this note. </p>
