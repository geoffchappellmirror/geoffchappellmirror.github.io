<h1>CL /D </h1>
<h2>Syntax </h2>
<blockquote>
  <p><span class="switch">/D</span><span class="placeholder">name</span>[<span class="switch">=</span>[<span class="placeholder">value</span>]]
  </p>
  <p><span class="switch">/D</span><span class="placeholder">name</span>[<span class="switch">#</span>[<span class="placeholder">value</span>]]
  </p>
  <p><span class="switch">/D=</span>[<span class="placeholder">value</span>] </p>
  <p><span class="switch">/D#</span>[<span class="placeholder">value</span>] </p>
</blockquote>
<!--webbot bot="Include" U-Include="_include/2plus.htm" TAG="BODY" startspan -->

<p>The required argument consists of whatever follows immediately within the same 
command-line token, else is the whole of the next command-line token. </p>

<!--webbot bot="Include" i-checksum="17496" endspan -->
<p>Failure to provide an argument is an error (<a href="../errors/d2004.htm">D2004</a>). 
There is no formal constraint on the length of the argument. </p>
<p>The argument is parsed into a <span class="placeholder">name</span> and
<span class="placeholder">value</span>. The <span class="placeholder">name</span> 
extends up to but not including the first # or = sign. Should anything remain in 
the argument, then in general, it becomes the <span class="placeholder">value</span>. 
For ease of reference, support for the # sign as the separator is henceforth taken 
as understood. Indeed, the first # sign in the argument actually is replaced by 
an = sign as far as concerns all subsequent interpretation of the argument by CL 
or communication to any compiler module. The coding has a side-effect, possibly 
by oversight: if the separator (as given) between <span class="placeholder">name</span> 
and <span class="placeholder">value</span> is an = sign, then the first # sign in
<span class="placeholder">value</span> (as interpreted) is changed to an = sign.
</p>
<h3>Relations </h3>
<p>A <span class="switch">/D</span> option with a <span class="placeholder">name</span> 
overrides earlier instances of <span class="switch">/D</span> with the same
<span class="placeholder">name</span>. A <span class="switch">/D</span> option with 
no <span class="placeholder">name</span> overrides earlier instances of <span class="switch">/D</span> with no
<span class="placeholder">name</span>. In neither case is there a warning. </p>
<p>The <span class="switch">/D</span> option passes to the front-end C and C++ compilers 
(C1 and C1XX). </p>
<h4>Defaults </h4>
<p>The following <span class="switch">/D</span> options are set by default, being 
hard-coded in CL as <a href="../initial.htm">initial options</a>: </p>
<ul>
  <li><span class="switch">-D_MSC_VER=1300</span> </li>
  <li><span class="switch">-D_MSC_FULL_VER=13009466</span> </li>
  <li><span class="switch">-D_WIN32</span> </li>
</ul>
<h2>Behaviour </h2>
<p>The <span class="switch">/D</span> option directs the compiler to define
<span class="placeholder">name</span> as a
<a href="../../../language/preprocessor/macros/index.htm">preprocessor macro</a> 
of the sort that has no argument list (as opposed to an empty argument list). The 
given <span class="placeholder">value</span>, after discarding any trailing white 
space in excess of one character, becomes the macro’s expansion. If the
<span class="switch">/D</span> option provides no value but ends with an = sign, 
then the macro is defined as having no expansion. With no = sign, the macro is defined 
as expanding to 1. </p>
<p>The syntax in which <span class="switch">/D</span> provides no
<span class="placeholder">name</span> is not invalid. The compiler actually does 
define a nameless macro, though this is surely redundant, at least in practice, 
unless there comes to light some way to access such a macro from source code. Indeed, 
the compiler imposes no formal syntax on the <span class="placeholder">name</span>. 
In particular, <span class="placeholder">name</span> need not be a C/C++ identifier, 
though there would seem to be no practical value to such a name, since there is 
again no way to access the resulting macro from source code. </p>
<p>Macro definitions in response to <span class="switch">/D</span> options are performed 
immediately after the compiler defines
<a href="../../../language/preprocessor/macros/builtin/index.htm">built-in macros</a>.
