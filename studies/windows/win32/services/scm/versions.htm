<h2>Builds </h2>
<!--webbot bot="Include" U-Include="../../_include/builds.htm" TAG="BODY" startspan -->

<p>The following builds have been inspected for these notes. Most are from MSDN 
discs. Some, especially since Microsoft greatly reduced its shipment of operating 
systems on MSDN discs, are from service packs downloaded (typically as self-extracting 
executables) from a Microsoft website. </p>
<p>Special mention must be made of the very oldest builds. Even among the many discs 
that I retain from MSDN subscriptions in the mid-1990s, what was then the new Windows 
that is entirely its own operating system rather than a large DOS program goes no 
further back than Windows NT 3.51. For all practical effect, Microsoft informally 
disowned the early versions, even for its so-called Archive editions. For decades 
I had little choice but to treat Windows NT 3.51 as the dawn of time for these notes. 
In 2017 someone pointed me to an online collection of earlier builds. The sample 
is inevitably incomplete. The provenance is unknown. I have since sought more: the
<a href="https://winworldpc.com/home">WinWorld</a> online museum is notable. </p>
<p>Builds are arranged in increasing order of the file version as recorded in the 
executable’s resources. This version number is readily visible using Windows Explorer 
either in a so-called infotip for the file or by accessing the Version tab in the 
Properties dialog for the file. Programmers know this version number as coming from 
the so-called root block of the version-information resource, specifically from 
the <span class="member">dwFileVersionMS</span> and <span class="member">dwFileVersionLS</span> 
members of a <span class="struct">VS_FIXEDFILEINFO</span> structure. </p>
<p>The date stamp shown for each version is more obscure. File dates are easily 
modified after the executable is built and are anyway liable to be shown differently 
when read from different time zones. However, there is in each executable’s header 
a date stamp which is set when the executable is built and which is not commonly 
changed afterwards. It is readily accessible to anyone with programming knowledge 
and appropriate tools, e.g., Microsoft’s own DUMPBIN utility. </p>
<p>Any one-person study of Windows—and please remember that the list below exists 
only as a catalogue of which builds I have obtained for study—is much too intensive 
for practical coverage of pre-release builds, hot fixes and other updates. </p>
<p>Access to pre-release builds anyway tends to come with constraints and compromise 
that other researchers may tolerate (and even be happy with) but which I do not. 
None of this work is done with any sort of assistance from Microsoft beyond the 
binaries, as published by the tens and even hundreds of millions, and the same documentation 
and other support, e.g., public symbol files for debugging, that’s available to 
all Windows programmers. </p>
