<h1>LdrQueryImageFileExecutionOptions </h1>
<p>The <span class="function">LdrQueryImageFileExecutionOptions</span> function 
queries one value in the <span class="regkey">Image File Execution 
Options</span> key for a named image file. </p>
<h2>Declaration </h2>
<pre class="source">NTSTATUS 
LdrQueryImageFileExecutionOptions (
    PUNICODE_STRING lpImageFile, 
    PCWSTR lpszOption, 
    ULONG dwType, 
    PVOID lpData, 
    ULONG cbData, 
    ULONG *lpcbData);</pre>
<h3>Parameters </h3>
<p>The <span class="argument">lpImageFile</span> argument names the executable image 
for which the option is sought. This can be <span class="constant">NULL</span> in 
version 6.0 and higher to query for global options. </p>
<!--webbot bot="Include" U-Include="_include/ifeoargs.htm" TAG="BODY" startspan -->

<p>The <span class="argument">lpszOption</span> argument names the one option whose 
value is sought. </p>
<p>The <span class="argument">dwType</span> argument specifies the type for the 
value as produced in the output buffer. This is typically also, but need not be, 
the required type for the value as stored in the registry. </p>
<p>The optional <span class="argument">lpData</span> and <span class="argument">
cbData</span> arguments are respectively the address and size of the output buffer 
that is to receive the value. These arguments can be <span class="constant">NULL</span> 
and zero to query for the option’s existence or size. </p>
<p>The optional <span class="argument">lpcbData</span> argument provides the address 
of a variable that is to receive the size, in bytes, of the value that the successful 
function has put into the buffer and which may receive the size that the failed 
function might have put into the buffer (had the buffer been large enough). This 
argument can be <span class="constant">NULL</span> if the caller does not want to 
know how much data is produced or is available. </p>

<!--webbot bot="Include" endspan i-checksum="29951" -->
<h3>Return Value </h3>
<!--webbot bot="Include" U-Include="../_include/ntstatus.htm" TAG="BODY" startspan -->

<p>The function returns <span class="constant">STATUS_SUCCESS</span> if successful, 
else a negative error code. </p>

<!--webbot bot="Include" endspan i-checksum="8" -->
<!--webbot bot="Include" U-Include="_include/80000005.htm" TAG="BODY" startspan -->

<p>Of particular importance is <span class="constant">STATUS_BUFFER_OVERFLOW</span>, 
which is the function’s indication that the buffer, if any, is too small for the 
whole value and that a size that would have sufficed has been set into the variable, 
if any, that was specified through the <span class="argument">lpcbData</span> argument.
</p>

<h2>Availability </h2>
<p>The <span class="function">LdrQueryImageFileExecutionOptions</span> function 
is exported by name from NTDLL.DLL in all known Windows versions, i.e., 3.10 and 
higher. </p>
<h2>Documentation Status </h2>
<p>The <span class="function">LdrQueryImageFileExecutionOptions</span> function 
is not documented. Neither is it declared in any C-language header that Microsoft 
is known to have published in any development kit for either user-mode or kernel-mode 
software. While Microsoft’s names and types for the function’s arguments are not known, this 
article uses inventions. </p>
<h2>Behaviour </h2>
<p>Starting with version 5.2, except on one point for version 10.0, the
<span class="function">LdrQueryImageFileExecutionOptions</span> is implemented as
<span class="function">
<a href="../rtl/rtlexec/queryimagefileexecutionoptionsex.htm">LdrQueryImageFileExecutionOptionsEx</a></span> 
with <span class="constant">FALSE</span> for the latter’s extra argument. Starting 
with version 6.1, there is effectively no difference since the newer function ignores 
its extra argument. </p>
<p>The exception for version 10.0 is that this older function fails trivially for 
secure processes. The error code is <span class="constant">STATUS_OBJECT_NAME_NOT_FOUND</span>. 
A secure process has the 0x80000000 bit set in the <span class="member">Flags</span> 
member of the process’s <span class="struct">RTL_USER_PROCESS_PARAMETERS</span> 
when the process initialised. </p>
<h3>Early History </h3>
<p>Before version 5.2, the <span class="function">LdrQueryImageFileExecutionOptions</span> 
function behaves differently from the later <span class="function">LdrQueryImageFileExecutionOptionsEx</span> 
in several respects, all of which may reasonably be disregarded nowadays as ancient 
coding errors. If they ever are written up for this website, they will be immediately 
below. For modern behaviour, look to the separate documentation of
<span class="function">LdrQueryImageFileExecutionOptionsEx</span> and read as if 
the new function had existed earlier. </p>
