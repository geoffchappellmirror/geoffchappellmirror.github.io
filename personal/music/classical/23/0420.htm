  <h1>Sir András Schiff Plays Bartók </h1>
  <div class="Abstract">
    <p>Concert by the New York Philharmonic on 20th April 2023, with Iván Fischer 
    (conductor) and András Schiff (pianist) as guests, performing works by Dohnányi, 
    Bartók and Mozart </p>
  </div>
  <p>Among my favourite CDs of classical music is a recording from 1996 of all three 
  piano concertos by the Hungarian composer Béla Bartók, played by the Hungarian-born 
  András Schiff and the Budapest Festival Orchestra conducted by the Hungarian-born 
  Iván Fischer. If pushed to choose ten CDs of classical music for a desert island, 
  these three piano concertos—which fit very neatly on one disc—would certainly 
  count as essential, though I confess that an older set by Géza Anda and Ferenc 
  Fricsay would win.<a class="FootnoteReference" name="FtnRef_ConcertoDiscs" href="#Ftn_ConcertoDiscs">[1]</a>
  </p>
  <p>That I tell you all this is because Schiff and Fischer were here in New York 
  this week and performed the third concerto with the New York Philharmonic. Even 
  had they paired this with something much less interesting than Mozart’s last symphony, 
  nothing would have kept me from being there to watch and listen. </p>
  <h2>Dohnányi </h2>
  <p>First up for the evening was <span class="title">Symphonic Minutes</span>, 
  a slight piece composed in 1933 by Ernő von Dohnányi. He too was Hungarian. He 
  wasn’t even five years older than Bartók but he lived much longer. Both died in 
  New York, Dohnányi in 1960 of pneumonia on a visit from an apparently comfortable 
  post-war life in Florida, Bartók in 1945 from living his war years here in ill 
  health and financial distress. Bartók while here wrote not only this third piano 
  concerto but also the <span class="title">Concerto for Orchestra</span>, both 
  of which are important contributions to the 20th-century repertory. These and 
  others of his later compositions get played so often here that Bartók sometimes 
  seems to have been adopted as a son of New York.<a class="FootnoteReference" name="FtnRef_SonOfNewYork" href="#Ftn_SonOfNewYork">[2]</a> 
  By contrast, though Dohnányi turns up in concerts and recordings far more often 
  now than a few decades ago, his whole output as a composer can still be safely 
  described as obscure. </p>
  <p>The program notes for the night go to some trouble to account for this obscurity 
  as a reaction to allegations of Nazi collaboration, and even of war crimes. There 
  plausibly is something to this: allegations did their damage, and still do despite 
  being long discredited. The New York Philharmonic never had Dohnányi perform as 
  a pianist in the many post-war years that he was readily available in America, 
  and never played the <span class="title">Symphonic Minutes</span> except the once 
  in 1940. </p>
  <p>Without in any way meaning to diminish the very real consequences of collaboation 
  or the complex debate about co-existing with wretched governments as they come 
  and go, I don’t think this history of unjust reputational damage is needed. The
  <span class="title">Symphonic Minutes</span> show well enough that Dohnányi, for 
  all his pre-war success as a pianist and conductor, was doomed to obscurity as 
  a composer by locking himself into a conservative style with insufficient innovation.
  </p>
  <p>This work in five movements is expertly well crafted, and is arguably even 
  a gem of its kind. Its 13 minutes passed for me in more than adequate enjoyment, 
  both for the composition and the execution. I shall be abundantly pleased to hear 
  this piece again and anything else he wrote of similar quality (until now I knew 
  of him mostly through chamber works), but its time in performance also passed 
  entirely without excitement. From this one listening alone, I should not have 
  been the slightest bit surprised if the program notes had told me that this music 
  was composed as long ago as 1870. </p>
  <p>As far as I know from reading, the cultural environment In 1933, or at any 
  time between the wars, not only in music and not only in America, was more than 
  usually consumed with moving on. It simply gave no space to new art that merely 
  repeated the old, however well. All ears were instead tuned to Stravinsky (who 
  also, as it happens, died in New York) and to the Second Viennese School, and 
  to any number of modern composers everywhere else who were exploring the academic 
  and emotional possibilities for taking music past the limits of tonality, and 
  in America to a generation of composers who were at long last finding a voice 
  that was distinct from European influence. In these years, writing in an old style 
  brought outright derision even to Rachmaninov despite his addition of unique ingenuity 
  by the bucket-load. However rewarding <span class="title">Symphonic Minutes</span> 
  is to listen to now, and likely was then, writing it in 1933 had no chance of 
  getting even the best of composers any appreciation. We do lose from this, even 
  though Dohnányi was no Rachmaninov. </p>
  <h2>Bartók </h2>
  <p>Bartók, by contrast, had already carved out a lasting place as an innovator—and 
  a highly individual one—even if it was not yet appreciated by American concert-goers 
  (and thus also concert-sponsors) when Bartók arrived here in 1940. </p>
  <p>As young men when the dying years of the Austro-Hungarian Empire saw Vienna 
  rise to a centre of everything intellectual in Europe while the national cultures 
  within the empire got ever more assertive in their yearning for independence, 
  Bartók and the very slightly younger Zoltán Kodály threw themselves into collecting 
  and cataloguing the folk musics of what we now know as Slovakia, Hungary and Romania. 
  They certainly weren’t the first musicians from the European tradition of tonal 
  music to look outside for inspiration. Debussy, for breaking pretty much everything 
  in the old rule book, surely had many special skills that might have got him there 
  anyway, yet he famously drew from exposure to oriental music, especially a gamelan, 
  that he heard at the Paris World Fair in 1889. Bartók and Kodály weren’t even 
  the first to find inspiration in specifically Hungarian folk music. But they studied 
  it systematically and Bartók—much more like Debussy in some ways than is often 
  remarked—incorporated its very different harmonies and rhythms into what plausibly 
  would anyway have been a distinctive personal style for all his compositions, 
  both large and small. </p>
  <p>Unlike Messiaen with his modes of transcription or Schoenberg with 12-tone 
  rows, Bartók is not known to have developed a formal system for taking his composition 
  beyond tonality. This has always stood out for me because Bartók was notoriously 
  a perfectionist, marking his scores with precise annotations all through. I guess 
  that this disposition left him very concerned to end with exactly what he wanted 
  without settling too soon on one set of strictures to escape another. The result 
  is a corpus that I find pleasingly novel yet easily accessible. I doubt I’m at 
  all alone in perceiving his work as more emotionally engaging than that of Schoenberg 
  or Stravinsky. </p>
  <p>Of Bartók’s three piano concertos, the first two are unquestionably the more 
  interesting as music to listen to and yet it’s the third that I honestly enjoy 
  the most. That my anticipation of this performance was not misplaced was immediately 
  apparent just from the first bars. These are sparsely populated, just some rapid 
  alternations between chords on <span class="musical">piano</span> violas and second 
  violins, a few quiet thuds of the timpani, the combination already suggestive 
  of mystery and disorientation and of promise too, which soon has its excitement 
  punched into place by the start of a jaunty tune <span class="musical">forte</span> 
  from the soloist. With the addition of long notes <span class="musical">piano</span> 
  from the clarinets and a little later from a flute, and some
  <span class="musical">pizzicato</span> on the lower strings, and much elaboration 
  of the jaunty tune, this introduction gets ever more complex without ever giving 
  up its naturalness. </p>
  <p>Does careful construction matter? Of course. Does knowledge of the details? 
  Arguably not. Still, I was spell-bound, for although I feel I have always responded 
  to this introduction’s setting of this concerto’s stage, I never had experienced 
  it even nearly so affectingly from recordings. As much as I like my hi-fi, even 
  to think that it reproduces as well as can be sensibly expected in a New York 
  apartment, nothing beats live performance by an orchestra that’s so well-chosen 
  and well-rehearsed that we can take fine technique in mood-setting for granted. 
  This, in a city that can easily be seen as being all about putting on a show, 
  is the essence of why I happily pay for good seats at concerts. </p>
  <p>As noted at the start, Schiff and Fischer have been playing the Bartók concertos 
  for a long, long time. Indeed, both are nearly ten years older now than was Bartók 
  at his death (which left this concerto with its last 17 bars to be finished by 
  a friend who I picture as honoured and eager yet apprehensive even though Bartók 
  had left a draft). Unlike more than a few of the 20th century’s most prominent 
  concertos, this music is not nearly so new that its performance could still be 
  dominated by original interpreters.<a class="FootnoteReference" name="FtnRef_OriginalDominance" href="#Ftn_OriginalDominance">[3]</a> 
  Indeed, this concerto never had the chance: Bartók was dead and the wife he left 
  it for (apparently to provide her with financial support) didn’t play it in public 
  for decades. But neither has it even now, nearly eighty years since composition, 
  been so long established in the repertory that modern performers treat it either 
  as a war-horse to play mechanically or as a vehicle for re-interpretation that 
  becomes quirky. Schiff and Fischer somehow gave the sense of being explorers while 
  plainly they are still safe hands. </p>
  <p>From perhaps no more than thirty feet away (fourth row, in the centre), I had 
  as good a view as anyone of Schiff’s body movements and facial expressions while 
  he played. The sceptic in me wonders, of course, how much of a performance might 
  be put on in this respect. The test is in the music. Put aside that the performance 
  anyway sounded different from others in David Geffen Hall for being played on 
  a Bösendorfer instead of the ubiquitous Steinway (and that we had the benefit 
  of second violins seated to the right), the piano playing itself sounded different 
  from my memory of a much-listened-to recording. Schiff has written that for all 
  Bartók’s meticulously detailed notation and respect of it in performance (as far 
  as can be known from recordings of Bartók playing others of his piano works), 
  the Bartók way is not to be a robot but to play with personality. It showed. I 
  was often transported and i was never disappointed. </p>
  <p>That said, I was once disoriented, and not just for a while but at a place 
  that’s vital for effect. I know from recordings that there is in the last movement 
  a brief but distinct silence before a change of tempo near the end. I would not 
  have said it was much different from the pause between second and third movements, 
  but I had to look at the score to see that the pause between movements is marked 
  explicitly as a comma and the pause within the third movement is specifically 
  two bars (641 and 642, immediately before changing from <span class="musical">
  Allegro vivace</span> to <span class="musical">Presto</span>). What I got on the 
  night was several seconds while pianist and conductor looked at each other for 
  cues. How much of this was deliberate is beyond my resources to determine, though 
  I note that my score is a revision from 1994 and its introduction picks out exactly 
  this tempo change among its edits. Please anyway do not mistake me in what weight 
  I give to this. Far more important is that I cannot remember any concerto for 
  which I have clapped so hard and for so long. </p>
  <h3>For Children </h3>
  <p>It’s customary, though not reliable with the New York Philharmonic, that the 
  soloist for a concerto ends the applause by playing an encore. There are broadly 
  two styles. Both have some element of showing off, of course. </p>
  <p>One is overt. For instance, suppose the main performance is Prokofiev’s second 
  piano concerto, whose <span class="musical">cadenza</span> in the first movement 
  must be among the most demanding of all. If what’s then chosen for an encore is 
  a whole movement of Prokofiev’s seventh piano sonata, the whole of which is legendary 
  for its complexity, you can safely interpret the pianist as drawing attention 
  to his ability to toss it off as if perfecting it cost nothing. I’m not grumbling 
  about glimpsing such talent. But I’d have happily paid for the same pianist’s 
  rendition of the whole sonata. </p>
  <p>Better as an encore, it seems to me, is the other style: take a small and even 
  simple piece and show off what you can bring to it with your extraordinary technique 
  and insight. Bartók left us with a large amount of such material, mostly as small 
  adaptations of folk tunes. Some are elaborated specially for performance. Many 
  more are polished less with a goal of performance than of instruction. Though 
  Bartók did play a few such pieces in his own concerts and recordings, he surely 
  never anticipated that his volumes <span class="title">For Children</span> would 
  ever be performed all the way through for an audience, let alone get complete 
  recordings (such as 442 146-2 by Zoltán Kocsis, inevitably another sometime collaborator 
  of Fischer’s). </p>
  <p>Schiff introduced his choice of encore by saying little more than “for children” 
  and only then indistinctly enough that my neighbours didn’t make it out. I can’t 
  say I recognised which one he played. I can say the audience’s absolute noiselessness 
  was not for politeness. </p>
  <h2>Mozart </h2>
  <p>History tells us that the dainty, manicured music—let’s call it stately—of 
  Mozart’s last symphony was once regarded as daring and even as controversial, 
  though apparently also as a restoration of civility after the one before (which 
  I can’t help note in passing has long been my favourite). They must have been 
  interesting times in their way, even if I exaggerate how this music was reacted 
  to when new. </p>
  <p>Among the complications is that although composers know very well that they 
  build on the past, they have a natural interest not just in singing their own 
  achievements but distancing from others’, if not dismissing them: Schubert famously, 
  though perhaps mischievously, asked why anyone still listens to Mozart! Though 
  audiences aren’t so fast, they too adjust their tastes as part of learning more. 
  Children anyway acquire their tastes with open minds (albeit with the constraint 
  of not being left to open inputs). Though I’m easily most comfortable with music 
  that was composed not very much before my birth and rarely more than another lifetime 
  earlier, Mozart’s <span class="title">Symphony No. 41 in C major</span> (widely 
  known as <span class="title">Jupiter</span>) was composed roughly four of my lifetimes 
  ago. Opportunity for changes of fashion has been abundant. </p>
  <p>This was specially on my mind for this concert for the usual reason but with 
  an emphasis. What’s usual is that choosing concerts in New York, if not everywhere, 
  almost always involves some compromise about how much old music to pay for. Having 
  been asked more than a few times with palpable despair something like how many 
  more of these modern string quartets (by Shostakovich, would you believe) are 
  still to come, I cannot attend a concert of Bartók and Mozart without wondering 
  how many of my neighbours have come for the Mozart and suffer the Bartók. </p>
  <p>Schiff and Fischer are etched into my mind on this point from an incident in 
  2011 when I was new to New York and just starting my first full-season sample 
  of live music in one of the world’s most significant centres of its performance. 
  Schiff and Fischer visited with the Budapest Festival Orchestra and played all 
  three Bartók piano concertos at Carnegie Hall. I stupidly went only on one night 
  and got only two concertos. I missed the other because the rest of the programme 
  on both nights was Schubert, much too much of it for my tastes even on the night 
  with two of the Bartók.<a class="FootnoteReference" name="FtnRef_Weighting" href="#Ftn_Weighting">[4]</a> 
  At the end of the night, Fischer asked out loud for a vote on the orchestra’s 
  encore. Who wants Bartók? Who wants Schubert? </p>
  <p>Or was it the other way round? Either way, it was charming, and though Fischer 
  plausibly can’t ever be anything but charming (and genuinely so), I expect he 
  was helped by knowing all along that he would have the orchestra play both, whatever 
  came of the vote. The vote’s result did not, however, go unnoticed. It even made 
  the <span class="title">New York Times</span>:
  <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/11/arts/music/emboldened-orchestras-embracing-the-new-music.html">
  Emboldened Orchestras Are Embracing the New</a>.<a class="FootnoteReference" name="FtnRef_NewYorkTimes" href="#Ftn_NewYorkTimes">[5]</a>
  </p>
  <p>Ten years (and a bit) on, how much has changed? Perhaps not much, but while 
  the practical business of managing orchestras and filling concert halls looks 
  set as continuing to see 20th-century music as needing a leavening, my take-away 
  from this concert is that if anyone who attended came for the Mozart symphony 
  and regarded the Bartók piano concerto as their compromise about what to pay for, 
  then I imagine they can’t have felt even slightly let down about this Mozart by 
  this orchestra with this guest conductor and they’ve experienced the Bartók as 
  well as can ever be expected. </p>

    <a class="Footnote" name="Ftn_ConcertoDiscs" href="#FtnRef_ConcerotDiscs">[1]</a>The 
    set by Schiff, Fischer and the Budapest Festival Orchestra is much the better 
    as a sound recording, as it would want to be in 1996. I have it as 0630-13158-2 
    on TELDEC. The earlier set was recorded in 1959 and 1960 for two LPs each released 
    the next year on Deutsche Grammaphon. They were remastered for release in 1995 
    on one CD: 447 399-2 in <span class="title">The Originals</span> series. These 
    originals, unlike some in the series, fully deserve their reputation. </p>
    <p><a class="Footnote" name="Ftn_SonOfNewYork" href="#FtnRef_SonOfNewYork">[2]</a>Think, 
    for instance, of how often the <span class="title">New World Symphony</span> 
    of Dvořák is played here. True, this is welcome and is even inevitable. The 
    symphony may even be the most popular of all throughout the English-speaking 
    world (to say nothing of its regard in the Czech Republic). But then convince 
    yourself that this high exposure in New York has nothing to do with the symphony’s 
    having been both written and first performed here—indeed, at Carnegie Hall by 
    the New York Philharmonic, which had commissioned it. Incidentally, if you have 
    any interest at all in New York’s musical history, then if you’re ever visiting 
    and find yourselves in the right parts of town you may like to remember that 
    Dvořák has a life-size statue in the garden at the north-east corner of Stuyvesant 
    Square and Bartók has a commemorative plaque at 309 West 57th Street. Of course, 
    to blow away my own theory, I leave you to find in obscurity the tiny plaque 
    where Edgard Varèse lived. </p>
    <p>
    <a class="Footnote" name="Ftn_OriginalDominance" href="#FtnRef_OriginalDominance">
    [3]</a>Contrast with the first violin and cello concertos of Shostakovich. If 
    permitted only one CD for my desert island, then my choice could only be MHK 
    63327 from Sony. It is just of these two concertos. Each is the first recording 
    by an American orchestra—the New York Philharmonic, as it happens, for the violin. 
    Each was made—in 1956 and 1959, respectively—within days of public performances 
    that weren’t many weeks later than the first public performances anywhere. The 
    composer was present for one of the recordings, and the soloist for each is 
    the piece’s dedicatee. Not only can you not get any more
    <span class="emphasis">definitive</span> than this, but since the dedicatees 
    are David Oistrakh and Mstislav Rostropovich, it was understandably decades 
    before even the brightest stars of new times committed to either of these works. 
    There are other recordings by Oistrakh. I even prefer the performance on a recording 
    for Melodia in poor sound only a little later the same year. Still, with the 
    possible exception of Leonid Kogan in 1960, nobody else’s recordings that I’ve 
    heard, let alone bought, are even imaginable as competition until Maxim Vengerov 
    in 1994. It may be no concidence that he plays it not unlike Oistrakh and that 
    the conductor is Rostropovich. </p>
    <p><a class="Footnote" name="Ftn_Weighting" href="#FtnRef_Weighting">[4]</a>That’s 
    how I weighted these things at the time, and I’m glad to be spared from testing 
    whether I’ve changed. I anyway had the small but non-negligible consolation 
    of already holding a ticket to a performance of the remaining concerto by other 
    hands in only a few months. Such ready availability is what we tell ourselves 
    comes free with living in cities like London and New York. </p>
    <p><a class="Footnote" name="Ftn_NewYorkTimes" href="#FtnRef_NewYorkTimes">[5]</a>If 
    I have the night right, then I am an indistinct spot in the darkness of this 
    article’s photograph. It’s the only way I’m getting into the
    <span class="title">New York Times</span>! More than two decades before, but 
    in my industry, I made some small contributions to stories that my collaborators 
    told me were taken up by this and other national newspapers. These stories were 
    about computer privacy. My collaborators had detected unusual behaviour and 
    observed closely enough to infer such things as the disguised sending of what 
    we now term personally identifying information. Manufacturers denied what was 
    going on. My contributions were to examne the software’s binary code for proof, 
    e.g., of the disguise by what in those days counted as encryption. Reverse engineering 
    back then was very much in its infancy and was far beyond any non-technical 
    reporting. That any stories about computer privacy were ever thought newsworthy 
    is so quaint now. </p>
