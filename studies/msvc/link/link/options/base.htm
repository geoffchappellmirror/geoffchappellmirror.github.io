<h1>LINK /BASE </h1>
<p>This option sets the preferred base address and maximum image size for the 
executable.
</p>
<h2>Syntax </h2>
<p>Two distinct syntaxes apply: </p>
<blockquote>
  <p><span class="switch">/base:@</span><span class="placeholder">filename</span><span class="switch">,</span><span class="placeholder">key</span><span class="switch">
  </span></p>
  <p><span class="switch">/base:</span><span class="placeholder">address</span>[<span class="switch">,</span><span class="placeholder">size</span>]<span class="switch">
  </span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>For the <span class="placeholder">filename</span>, <span class="placeholder">
address</span> and <span class="placeholder">size</span> arguments, characters 
up to but not including an equals sign are ignored without complaint. The 
filename syntax is selected if the first argument begins with an @ sign. 
Otherwise, the address syntax applies. </p>
<p>If a <span class="switch">/base</span> option (with at least one argument) is 
given as a directive in an object file and the base address is regarded as 
having been set by an earlier instance, then the option is ignored without 
complaint. Thus,
<span class="switch">/base</span> is valid as a directive in an object file but 
cannot override a <span class="switch">/base</span> from the command line. </p>
<h3>Address Syntax </h3>
<p>It is a fatal error (LNK1147) if the <span class="placeholder">address</span> 
argument is not interpretable as a 64-bit number. The same fatal error results 
if the optional <span class="placeholder">size</span> argument is not a number 
no greater than 0x80000000. Provision of more than two arguments is a fatal 
error (LNK1111).
</p>
<h3>Filename Syntax </h3>
<p>The filename syntax requires two arguments. The <span class="placeholder">
filename</span> 
argument names a text file, here called the <span class="definition">base file</span>, 
that may list choices for what the address syntax would have allowed as the
<span class="placeholder">address</span> and <span class="placeholder">size</span>. 
The <span class="placeholder">key</span> argument selects from the choices. </p>
<p>The <span class="placeholder">filename</span> is interpreted according to the 
usual rules for <a href="../../infiles.htm">default extensions and search paths 
for input files</a>, but with “.txt” as the default extension. The file counts 
as an input file for the purpose of <a href="../../repro.htm">test-case 
reproduction</a>. It is a fatal error (LNK1104) if the file cannot be opened for 
reading in text mode with write access denied to sharers. </p>
<p>The base file is parsed in lines. For this purpose, a line is as many as 259 
characters up to and including a line-feed (or carriage-return and line-feed, 
allowing for text-mode translation) or the last byte of text, whichever comes 
first. On any given line, a terminating line-feed is ignored, as are all 
characters from the first semicolon onwards. </p>
<p>The <span class="placeholder">key</span> argument selects one line. There may 
be any number of spaces and tabs, including none, before the case-insensitive
<span class="placeholder">key</span>, which must in turn run to a space or tab 
or to the end of the line. Only the first matching line matters. </p>
<p>If no line matches the <span class="placeholder">key</span>, warning LNK4198 
occurs. Though the text of this warning reads as if LINK reverts to a default, 
there are some subtleties. If an earlier <span class="switch">/base</span> set a 
valid
<span class="placeholder">address</span>, then the earlier setting persists. 
Otherwise, LINK treats this <span class="switch">/base</span> as having set the
<span class="placeholder">address</span> successfully, as if to a value that 
just happens to be the default. At this stage, the default is 0x00400000 
irrespective of any special cases about subsystem or executable type. This is 
not the same as having given no <span class="switch">/base</span> option, but is 
instead the same as having given <span class="switch">/base:0x00400000</span> 
explicitly. </p>
<p>The syntax expected of the matching line is: </p>
<blockquote>
  <p><span class="placeholder">key</span><span class="statement"> </span>
  <span class="placeholder">address</span><span class="statement"> </span>
  <span class="placeholder">size</span><span class="statement"> </span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>There may be any number of spaces and tabs, including none, before the
<span class="placeholder">key</span>. There must be at least one space or tab 
before the <span class="placeholder">address</span> and before the
<span class="placeholder">size</span>, which must in turn run to a space or tab 
or to the end of the line. </p>
<p>The <span class="placeholder">address</span> and size arguments are numbers 
in decimal or in C-language hexadecimal or octal notation, with a sign prefix 
allowed, evaluated as unsigned integers truncated to 64 and 32 bits 
respectively. For each, excess (non-numerical) characters are ignored without 
complaint. It is a fatal error (LNK1111) not to provide both an <span class="placeholder">
address</span> and a
<span class="placeholder">size</span>. It is a fatal error (LNK1147) if the size 
is greater than 0x80000000. </p>
