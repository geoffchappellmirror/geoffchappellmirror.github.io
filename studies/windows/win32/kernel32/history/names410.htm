<h1>Named Exports Added For KERNEL32 4.10 </h1>
<p>The table below lists all the functions that are first exported from KERNEL by 
name in version 4.10, i.e., for Windows 98. </p>
<p>Functions that appear to be completely undocumented are
<span class="undocumented">highlighted yellow</span>. These are all specific to 
the Windows that runs on DOS. Put another way, they do not survive beyond version 
4.90. </p>
<p>A few functions are <span class="declared">shaded yellow</span> because although 
they are not documented they are at least declared in a header file from the Windows 
SDK. All seem to have been documented originally. They are certainly documented 
in the MSDN Library on CD dated January 1999. However, this documentation got dropped 
before the MSDN Library on CD dated January 2001. </p>
<p>A few functions were documented in the MSDN Library on CD dated January 2004 
as having Windows 98 as the minimum requirement, but a revision before the MSDN 
Library on CD dated January 2007 changed the minimum to Windows 2000. This might 
pass as a natural shedding of old versions as they become unsupported, were it done 
consistently. </p>
