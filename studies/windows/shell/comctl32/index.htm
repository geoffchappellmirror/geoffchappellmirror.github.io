<h1>The Common Controls Library </h1>
<p>Windows programmers know of the Common Controls library (COMCTL32.DLL) as the 
provider of the more interesting window controls. While USER32.DLL sees to the 
basic functionality of user input through plain, boring buttons, edit boxes and 
even combo boxes, COMCTL32 delivers progress bars and elaborate constructions 
such as tree views and property sheets. Thus, through all the history of 32-bit 
Windows programming, and even before, the common controls have been the ones 
that do the most to lend an application the appearance of being professionally 
written or at least of being up-to-date with its gadgetry. </p>
<h2>Tomorrow Now </h2>
<p>Use of the Common Controls library can even make a program seem ahead of its 
time. The “cool bar” that gave Internet Explorer 3.0 so distinctive an 
appearance when run on Windows 95 was provided by having Internet Explorer 
install an updated COMCTL32. Programmers of other Windows applications could 
deliver that same improved look-and-feel by coding for the new COMCTL32 features 
and persuading their customers to install Internet Explorer, for free, instead 
of waiting for them to upgrade Windows, at a price. </p>
<p>At the time, Microsoft was not overt about leveraging improvements to Windows 
as a mechanism for establishing Internet Explorer, but neither did Microsoft 
keep it much of a secret. See for instance the article <span class="citation">
Previewing the New and Improved Common Controls DLL for Microsoft IE 4.0</span> 
by Strohm Armstrong in the October and November 1996 issues of <span class="citation">
Microsoft Systems Journal</span>: </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>To run the samples, you will need to have the COMCTL32.DLL that ships with 
  Microsoft Internet Explorer 3.0, beta 2 or greater, installed on your system. 
  (<i>Confused? Here&#39;s the skinny: even though these new common controls are not 
  officially released and distributable, they are included with IE 3.0. For now, 
  you have to install IE 3.0 to get them—Ed.</i>) </p>
</blockquote>
<p>That programmers will seek new Windows functionality by looking to Internet 
Explorer is shown in the September issue’s <span class="citation">Under the Hood</span> 
by Matt Pietrek: </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>For starters, the TreeView control offers no searching capabilities (not 
  even in the new TreeView from the new Common Controls DLL, which ships with 
  Microsoft Internet Explorer 3.0). </p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Common Functions </h2>
<p>The Common Controls DLL also implements what we may as well describe as 
common functions. These have no essential relationship with the common controls, 
but they are common in much the same sense as the common controls. The one copy 
of the code, in COMCTL32.DLL, can serve many executables that would otherwise 
each have to carry their own code for doing essentially the same work. </p>
