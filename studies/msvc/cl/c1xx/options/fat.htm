<h1>C1XX -FAT </h1>
<h2>Syntax </h2>
<p>This option has no arguments. It is <span class="switch">-FAT</span> only.
</p>
<p>This option is not recognised on the CL command line, but can be passed to C1XX 
through the CL <span class="switch"><a href="../../cl/options/d1.htm">/d1</a></span> 
option, giving <span class="switch">FAT</span> as its argument. </p>
<h2>Behaviour </h2>
<p>With this option enabled, C1XX truncates file names and extensions to 8 and 3 
characters respectively when opening source files (and include files). Note however 
that truncation is not performed when testing for a file’s existence or when citing 
a file in error messages and other such output. </p>
<p>Whatever merit this option may have had once upon a time, it is plausibly useless 
in practice and is perhaps retained in C1XX only by oversight (and particularly 
by having been eliminated only incompletely). </p>
<h3>Example </h3>
<p>Prepare two simple include files, one named ERRORMESSAGES.H containing the line
</p>
<pre class="source">#define __ERRORMESSAGES_INCLUDED__</pre>
<p>and the other with the truncated name ERRORMES.H containing a similar line
</p>
<pre class="source">#define __ERRORMES_INCLUDED__</pre>
<p>The intention is that each include file provides a means to test whether it has 
been included. Prepare also a source file with a <span class="directive">#include</span> 
that refers to the long name ERRORMESSAGES.H and with code to report which file 
actually got included: </p>
<pre class="source">#include   &quot;errormessages.h&quot;

#ifdef __ERRORMESSAGES_INCLUDED__
#pragma message (&quot;Actually included:    errormessages.h&quot;)
#endif

#ifdef __ERRORMES_INCLUDED__
#pragma message (&quot;Actually included:    errormes.h&quot;)
#endif</pre>
<p>Compilation with <span class="switch">/showIncludes</span> produces </p>
<pre class="output">Note: including file: g:\temp\errormessages.h
Actually included:    errormessages.h</pre>
<p>in which the first line is from the compiler, at the direction of the
<span class="switch">/showIncludes</span> option, and the second confirms that it 
was&nbsp; ERRORMESSAGES.H, with the long name, that actually got included. The existence 
of the other file, ERRORMES.H, is irrelevant. </p>
<p>Recompile with <span class="switch">/d1FAT</span> added to the options, and the 
output changes: </p>
<pre class="output">Note: including file: g:\temp\errormessages.h
Actually included:    errormes.h</pre>
<p>Whatever file the compiler may say it was including, the file it actually included 
was the one with the short name. Note however that both files must exist. </p>
