  <p class="alert">This page is being prepared for a substantial reworking. Some 
  content may be temporarily missing. Temporarily may turn into indefinitely. New 
  content may be more than usually defective. The page is now published only as 
  a revision in progress. Use with caution. </p>
  <h1>SYSTEM_TRACE_HEADER </h1>
  <p>The <span class="struct">SYSTEM_TRACE_HEADER</span> is one of several types 
  of fixed-size header that introduce variable-size data for events that are logged 
  through Event Tracing for Windows (ETW). As with other types of event, those that 
  begin with a <span class="struct">SYSTEM_TRACE_HEADER</span> accumulate first 
  in trace buffers. To have these events persist in this raw form for ready inspection, 
  configure the event tracing session to flush the trace buffers to an Event Trace 
  Log (ETL) file. </p>
  <h2>Documentation Status </h2>
  <p>The <span class="struct">SYSTEM_TRACE_HEADER</span> is not documented, but 
  a C-language definition is published in the NTWMI.H from the Enterprise edition 
  of the Windows Driver Kit (WDK) for Windows 10 version 1511. </p>
  <!--webbot bot="Include" U-Include="../../../../api/etw/_include/appxdeploymentclient.htm" TAG="BODY" startspan -->

<p>Were it not for this relatively recent and possibly unintended disclosure, much 
would anyway be known from type information in symbol files. Curiously though, type 
information for this structure has never appeared in any public symbol files for 
the kernel or for the obvious low-level user-mode DLLs. In the whole of Microsoft’s 
packages of public symbol files, at least to the original Windows 10, relevant type 
information is unknown before Windows 8 and appears in symbol files only for AppXDeploymentClient.dll, 
CertEnroll.dll (before Windows 10) and Windows.Storage.ApplicationData.dll. </p>

  <h2>Layout </h2>
  <p>The <span class="struct">SYSTEM_TRACE_HEADER</span> is 0x20 bytes in both 32-bit 
  and 64-bit Windows in all versions that are known to have it at all, i.e., 5.0 
  and higher. Be aware, however, that the structure can exist in a so-called compact 
  form that is only the first 0x18 bytes. </p>

  <p>To these markers must yet be added the <span class="member">Version</span>. 
  Though the <span class="member">Version</span> is formally the low word, the kernel 
  treats it as 8-bit. It is presently thought that this <span class="member">Version</span> 
  is not of the header but of the event-specific data that follows the header. Both 
  0x02 and 0x03 are observed in Windows 10. </p>
  <h3>Packet </h3>
  <p>The second four bytes are shared by <span class="struct">SYSTEM_TRACE_HEADER</span>

  less old headers for system events. </p>

<p>The total size of data for the event, i.e., both the fixed-size header and the 
variable-size event data, is given by the <span class="member">Size</span> member 
of the <span class="member">Packet</span>, i.e., at offset 0x04 in the header. The
<span class="member">HookId</span> at offset 0x06 in the header tells what type 
of event is logged and determines the meaning of whatever event data follows the 
header. In the absence of an <span class="struct">EVENT_DESCRIPTOR</span> for events 
that have a <span class="struct">SYSTEM_TRACE_HEADER</span>, the
<span class="member">HookId</span> is effectively the event identifier (no matter 
that by the time it gets translated for consumers its <span class="member">Group</span> 
and <span class="member">Type</span> show as a <span class="member">ProviderId</span> 
and <span class="member">Opcode</span>). A list of the known

presented separately. </p>

  <p>The remaining members may pass as self-explanatory, but note that the
  <span class="member">SystemTime</span> is named in contrast to the kernel and 
  user times, not to imply use of system time as the clock. </p>
