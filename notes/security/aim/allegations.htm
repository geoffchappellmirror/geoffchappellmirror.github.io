  <h1>The Allegations </h1>
  <p>Although in principle any given software can be reviewed in its entirety for 
  coding defects, in practice something prompts the analysis. Usually, the prompt 
  is an observation of unwelcome behaviour in the software. The search for defects 
  is then confined to just the one (or more) that will explain that particular observation. 
  For the case at hand, the observation of unwelcome behaviour was made by someone 
  else to someone else before being brought to my attention through yet another 
  someone else. </p>
  <h2>The Phil Bucking Correspondence </h2>
  <p>Someone purporting to be named Phil Bucking, with an address at Yahoo, sent 
  e-mail to Richard M. Smith, president of Phar Lap Software and a well-regarded 
  expert on Internet security. The e-mail is primarily concerned with America Online 
  (AOL) and its AOL Instant Messenger (AIM) software, but in connection with Microsoft 
  (MS) and its MS Instant Messenger software. </p>
  <p>In this <a href="bucking.htm#Allegation">first e-mail from Phil Bucking</a>, 
  the key allegations seem to be that: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>the AIM client has a buffer overflow bug; </li>
    <li>AOL exploits its knowledge of the bug to get the AIM client to execute code 
    sent by the AIM server; </li>
    <li>the code causes the AIM client to return information to the AIM server;
    </li>
    <li>the MS Instant Messenger client does not have the bug and does not execute 
    the downloaded code; </li>
    <li>AOL uses this to distinguish an MS Instant Messenger client from an AIM 
    client. </li>
  </ul>
  <p>Support for the allegations was offered in a <a href="bucking.htm#Evidence">
  second e-mail from Phil Bucking</a>. This e-mail deconstructs as: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>presentation of a data packet that is said to have been received during 
    an AIM session with AOL; </li>
    <li>interpretation of the start of this data packet in terms of a supposed AIM 
    protocol; </li>
    <li>interpretation of the remainder of the first data packet as executable code;
    </li>
    <li>assertion that this code does execute; </li>
    <li>presentation of a data packet that the AIM client is said to have sent back 
    in response; </li>
    <li>interpretation of the sent data as being derived from the received data.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>The <span class="emphasis">presentations</span>, taken at face value, may serve 
  as keys to focus an analysis of the AIM client software on just those parts that 
  are relevant to the observed behaviour. No analysis can be considered to be near 
  to success until it explains all the reliable observations. </p>
  <p>By contrast, the <span class="emphasis">interpretations</span> are not to be 
  relied upon at all, but are to be tested by the analysis. </p>
  <p>Especially suspect is the <span class="emphasis">assertion</span> that the 
  AIM client software does actually execute at least some of the observed data packet. 
  As his experimental method, the writer changed some of the packet and saw that 
  “the execution of AIM changed in a corresponding fashion.” Without details of 
  the changes made to the packet and of the effect this had on the AIM client’s 
  execution, there is no inference at all that the AIM client actually executed 
  anything from the packet. When bytes are changed in data given as input to any 
  code, a change in behaviour is only to be expected. Why else give any input? A 
  change in behaviour from a change of input data certainly doesn’t mean that the 
  data got executed. </p>
  <p>Indeed, nowhere in either e-mail from Phil Bucking is there any clear expression 
  of why the writer believes that there is a buffer overflow bug, let alone that 
  the given data packet shows this bug being exploited by AOL to execute downloaded 
  code. </p>
  <h2>A Connection with Microsoft </h2>
  <p>Controversy followed Richard Smith’s observation that the e-mail from Phil 
  Bucking, though it purported to come from a Yahoo address, had come through a 
  proxy at Microsoft and had presumably originated inside Microsoft. The e-mail 
  was clearly much more closely related to reports of a dispute between AOL and 
  Microsoft concerning Instant Messaging (IM) than Phil Bucking had suggested.
  </p>
  <p>The story of this correspondence’s apparent connection with Microsoft was taken 
  up in the New York Times. On 13th August, an on-line article
  <a target="_top" href="http://www.zdnet.com/pcweek/stories/news/0,4153,1015972,00.html">
  Accusations fly in latest twist to Microsoft/AOL saga</a> by Christa Degnan quotes 
  Rob Bennett, director of marketing at Microsoft Network (MSN), as saying “it is 
  not clear if the e-mail was generated from Microsoft” but that “if it was, it 
  was the action of an individual and not anything sanctioned or in line with our 
  policies.” (The given link is where the article was published at the time, but 
  it seems to be invalid now.) </p>
  <p>On the subject matter of the e-mail, the article provides some quotes that 
  invite a return after the facts, such as existence of the alleged bug, are established. 
  Bennett, at MSN, seems to be at ease repeating the allegations in the e-mail, 
  and offers the opinion that the dubiousness of the story’s source “really doesn’t 
  excuse AOL’s actions of putting its users at risk.” From Tricia Primrose for AOL: 
  “It is important to recognize this is a fake story about a fake e-mail about a 
  fake issue.” </p>
  <p>Neither Bennett nor Primrose come out of this with any credit. Say what you 
  will about Microsoft, especially about its record of honest disclosure, but this 
  story provides yet more support for anyone’s suspicion that Microsoft’s competitors 
  would be as bad, if not worse, if given half a chance. </p>
  <h3>Protocols </h3>
  <p>A particular point to understand in this controversy is that Microsoft has 
  developed its own Instant Messaging (IM) software, named MSN Messenger Service. 
  In the IM market, Microsoft is the latecomer. Users who seek IM facilities will 
  most naturally register with AOL, which appears to have developed the concept 
  and certainly offers the largest and best-established community of IM users. To 
  compete, Microsoft’s IM client software must give Microsoft’s IM users full access 
  to the many IM users who have already registered with AOL. </p>
  <p>Those AOL users run the AIM client software, which talks across the network 
  with AIM server software. Here, <span class="definition">talk</span> means an 
  exchange of data packets that the client and server software each interpret according 
  to some protocol. Given that the software at both ends is written by AOL, the 
  protocol can be whatever AOL has cared to design. </p>
  <p>The job of giving Microsoft’s IM users access to AOL’s IM users is therefore 
  the job of writing the MSN client so that it can talk with an AIM server according 
  to the same protocol that the AIM server understands when talking with an AIM 
  client. Microsoft’s MSN client must mimic AOL’s AIM client, almost as if the AIM 
  server should not know the difference. </p>
  <p>Such mimicry is complicated by AOL’s having apparently not published any description 
  of the AIM protocol, at least not to Microsoft or not in sufficient detail for 
  practicable development of a substitute for the AIM client. In terms that some 
  at Microsoft will surely recognise, though perhaps only with a sense of irony, 
  Microsoft has given itself the work of cloning the AIM client from AOL but has 
  the problem that AOL has not documented all the AIM client’s interfaces. </p>
  <h3>Reverse Engineering </h3>
  <p>To discover some usable approximation to the AIM protocol as actually designed 
  and implemented by AOL, Microsoft may have conducted experiments. The idea would 
  be to watch the exchange of data across the network during a variety of AIM sessions, 
  hoping to discern patterns and eventually to infer what interpretation AOL’s software 
  at each end places on all the data packets seen to have been sent and received. 
  Some, and Microsoft may be among them, have been known to call such examinations 
  reverse engineering, often dismissively. </p>
  <p>Was Phil Bucking, if that be a real name, a Microsoft programmer engaged in 
  reverse engineering the AIM protocol for use by Microsoft’s own Instant Messaging 
  software? </p>
  <h2>Next… </h2>
  <p>There are certainly many points of interest in the allegations and also in 
  the reported reactions by both AOL and Microsoft. If software analysis is to provide 
  any clues—and better yet, authority—then a good way to start must be to
  <a href="bug.htm">look for the buffer overflow bug</a> that Phil Bucking starts 
  his allegations with. </p>
