<h1>SHIsRestricted2W </h1>
<p>This function tests the value of an Internet Explorer restriction and displays 
a message box if the restriction applies. </p>
<h2>Declaration </h2>
<pre class="source">BOOL
SHIsRestricted2W (
    HWND hwnd,
    RESTRICTIONS2 rest,
    LPCWSTR url,
    DWORD reserved);</pre>
<h3>Parameters </h3>
<p>The <span class="argument">hWnd</span> argument provides a handle to the window 
that should own the message box, or is NULL. </p>
<p>The <span class="argument">rest</span> argument selects the restriction whose 
value is wanted. The supported values in the <span class="enum">
<a href="restrictions2.htm">RESTRICTIONS2</a></span> enumeration are listed separately.
</p>
<p>The <span class="argument">url</span> argument, if not NULL, supplies a URL to 
evaluate the restriction for, most notably with respect to the URL’s security zone.
</p>
<p>The <span class="argument">reserved</span> argument must be zero. </p>
<h3>Return Value </h3>
<p>The function returns <span class="constant">TRUE</span> if the selected restriction 
evaluates to anything other than zero. Otherwise, the function returns
<span class="constant">FALSE</span>. </p>
<h2>Behaviour </h2>
<p>This function exists as a convenience for the case where a restriction is a boolean 
indicator of whether some Internet Explorer feature is restricted from use, typically 
as an administrative policy. The restriction is evaluated by calling SHDOCVW’s own 
function <span class="function"><a href="shrestricted2.htm">SHRestricted2</a></span> 
(passing the arguments as given, except for the window handle). If the feature turns 
out to be restricted, then the SHLWAPI function <span class="function">
<a href="../../../../shell/shlwapi/api/util/restrictions/messagebox.htm">SHRestrictedMessageBox</a></span> 
is called to alert the user. </p>
<p>In version 6.0 and higher, SHDOCVW may have an activation context. If so, this 
is activated for the call to <span class="function">SHRestrictedMessageBox</span>.
</p>
<h3>Shell Separation in Windows Vista </h3>
<p>For the version 6.0 from Windows Vista, and higher, the preceding explanation 
of behaviour remains true of the implementation in SHDOCVW, but this is not the 
implementation that is accessed by importing <span class="function">SHIsRestricted2W</span> 
from SHDOCVW. The function is duplicated in a new DLL, named IEFRAME, and is exported 
from there. SHDOCVW forwards all import requests to the copy that is exported from 
IEFRAME. The implementation in SHDOCVW still seems to have one way of getting used, 
but only internally (and even this may be due to oversight or to some difficulty 
in shedding it completely). In version 6.1, the implementation in SHDOCVW is eliminated 
entirely. </p>
<p>For the IEFRAME implementation, the two called functions are not called from 
SHDOCVW and SHLWAPI. First, although SHDOCVW retains an implementation of
<span class="function">SHRestricted2</span> (in version 6.0), it is inaccessible. 
The exported implementation is in IEFRAME and that is what IEFRAME calls. Second, 
though <span class="function">SHRestrictedMessageBox</span> continues to be exported 
from SHLWAPI, IEFRAME has its own copy and that is what IEFRAME calls. </p>
<h4>Internet Explorer 7 </h4>
<p>This “separation” of Internet Explorer functionality from Windows seems to have 
been prepared some years in advance of Windows Vista. Starting with the version 
6.0 from Windows XP SP2 and from Windows Server 2003 SP1, including builds from 
the Internet Explorer 7 and 8 packages for Windows XP and Windows Server 2003, the 
SHDOCVW implementation of <span class="function">SHIsRestricted2W</span> is aware 
that an IEFRAME implementation may be present from installation of Internet Explorer 
7 or 8. The exported function is not actually <span class="function">SHIsRestricted2W</span> 
itself but <span class="function">SHIsRestricted2W_IeframeProxy</span>. The proxy 
may have been intended to redirect the function to the IEFRAME implementation when 
IEFRAME is indeed present. As actually coded however, all the proxy does is save 
the address of the IEFRAME implementation before proceeding anyway to execute the 
rest of the SHDOCVW implementation. </p>
<h2>Availability </h2>
<p>The <span class="function">SHIsRestricted2W</span> function is exported from
</p>
<ul>
  <li>SHDOCVW as ordinal 160 in version 5.0 and higher; </li>
  <li>IEFRAME as ordinal 160 in version 7.0 and higher. </li>
</ul>
<p>In version 6.0 from Windows Vista, and higher, SHDOCVW continues to export the 
function but only by forwarding it to IEFRAME. </p>

<p>Though this function dates from as long ago as 1999, it was still not 
documented by Microsoft as late as the January 2007 edition of the Windows Vista 
Software Development Kit (SDK). </p>
