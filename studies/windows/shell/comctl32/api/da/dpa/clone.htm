<h1>DPA_Clone </h1>
<p>This function sets up one DPA to list the same items as another. </p>
<h2>Declaration </h2>
<pre class="source">HDPA
DPA_Clone (
    const HDPA hdpaSource,
    HDPA hdpaNew);</pre>
<h3>Parameters </h3>
<p>The <span class="argument">hdpaSource</span> argument provides a handle to the 
DPA whose list of items is to be cloned. </p>
<p>The <span class="argument">hdpaNew</span> argument provides a handle to an existing 
(target) DPA that is to receive the cloned list, or is NULL to create a new DPA 
as the target. </p>
<h3>Return Value </h3>
<p>The function returns a handle to the target DPA if successful, else NULL for 
failure. </p>
<h2>Behaviour </h2>
<p>This function copies the pointer array from one DPA to another. The target DPA 
may exist already, but if <span class="argument">hdpaNew</span> is NULL, the function 
creates a new DPA as the target. If necessary, the target DPA grows to meet the 
capacity of the source DPA. If the target DPA existed already, then all its old 
pointers are lost. </p>
<p>Though the pointer array is duplicated exactly, other features are not necessarily. 
If a new DPA is created as the target, it is configured to use the same heap as 
the source DPA and it inherits the source DPA’s allocation unit. However, if an 
existing DPA is given as the target, it continues to use whatever heap was selected 
for it at creation and it retains its allocation unit. Growth of a pre-existing 
target whose allocation unit differs from the source DPA may result in the target 
ending with a greater capacity than the source. Whether the target is new or existed 
already, its allocation unit may increase as a side-effect of any growth in capacity.
</p>
<p>A simple coding error in the function’s clean-up on failure affects almost all 
versions. The natural clean-up is that if the function creates a target DPA but 
then has to fail, it should destroy this new target that it created and that nobody 
can want. Instead, the function has its clean-up logic inverted: the function destroys 
the target on failure only if the target pre-existed. This error is fixed in the 
version 5.82 from Windows Vista and higher, and in version 6.10 and higher. </p>
<h2>Availability </h2>
<p>The <span class="function">DPA_Clone</span> function is exported from 
COMCTL32.DLL as ordinal 331 in version 3.50 and higher. The implementation for 
version 6.10 and higher is built into a statically linked library and thence is 
also exported from the Internet Explorer module IERTUTIL.DLL as ordinal 73 in 
version 7.0 and higher. </p>

<p>Though this function dates from as long ago as 1995, it was still not 
documented by Microsoft in the MSDN Library at least as late as the CD edition 
dated January 2004. </p>

<p>This function has, however, got documented since then (in 2006 or perhaps 
some time during 2005). This article now uses Microsoft’s nomenclature. </p>
