/*  This script eases the inclusion of expandable digressions in a document. 
    Each example is some arbitrary amount of HTML which is not wanted in the 
    ordinary flow but which the reader is invited to reveal, if in the mind 
    for diversion. 

    All the HTML for the example goes into a DIV. If scripting is enabled, 
    the DIV is hidden and a "show" button appears in its place. Clicking the 
    button reveals the DIV and the "show" turns to "hide". 

    The example may have its own user-interface name, for use in relevant 
    buttons. Set this as the ID of the DIV.  */
