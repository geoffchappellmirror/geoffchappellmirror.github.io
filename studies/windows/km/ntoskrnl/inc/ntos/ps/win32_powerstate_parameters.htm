  <h1>WIN32_POWERSTATE_PARAMETERS </h1>
  <p>The <span class="struct">WIN32_POWERSTATE_PARAMETERS</span> (formally
  <span class="struct">_WIN32_POWERSTATE_PARAMETERS</span>) is a structure that 
  the kernel passes to WIN32K.SYS (or, if only in principle, whoever else registered 
  instead) to provide for notification of significant events in the kernel’s changing 
  of power state. </p>
  <p>Microsoft is known (see below for sources) to define the pointer type
  <span class="type">PKWIN32_POWERSTATE_PARAMETERS</span>. Note the K, presumaby 
  for kernel. </p>
  <h2>Documentation Status </h2>
  <p>Even among undocumented structures, the <span class="struct">WIN32_POWERSTATE_PARAMETERS</span> 
  is unusually obscure. Except for what looks to be known from leaked source code 
  and then recirculated as research, Microsoft’s name for this enumeration, let 
  alone for any of its members, was unknown for decades—and then Microsoft disclosed 
  the whole of it twice. </p>
  <p>First is a C-language definition in the NTOSP.H which Microsoft published with 
  the Windows Driver Kit (WDK) for the original and 1511 releases of Windows 10. 
  Publication of this header was apparently an oversight. Though it is chock full 
  of previously undisclosed definitions for kernel-mode programming, it is supplied 
  in a subdirectory (named “minwin”) of a directory named “um” as if to suggest 
  user-mode programming. Mistake or not, this disclosure has not been repeated in 
  later kits. </p>
  <p>The second disclosure is in type information from symbol files for a driver 
  named NetAdapterCx.sys. Starting with the 1803 release of Windows 10, the symbol 
  files for this driver, as made available by Microsoft at its public symbol server, 
  are private symbol files. They have type information for the
  <span class="struct">WIN32_POWERSTATE_PARAMETERS</span> from the driver’s inclusion 
  of NTOSP.H. </p>
  <h2>Variability and Size </h2>
  <p>That the <span class="struct">WIN32_POWERSTATE_PARAMETERS</span> are shared 
  between separate executable modules might lend stability, but the intended modules 
  are very much tied to the Windows version, one by definition, being the kernel, 
  and the other for being so important to Windows in real-world use that its use 
  with a mismatched kernel is all but unthinkable. The <span class="function">PsEstablishWin32Callouts</span> 
  function that registers the routines for the kernel to call has frequently changed 
  its prototype, and so it should not surprise that what’s shared through this interface 
  changes too. </p>
  <p>That said, the structure is small: the only changes have been that one member 
  has been removed and another appended. Moreover, all members are simple enough 
  that the structure is the same for both 32-bit and 64-bit Windows. </p>

  <p>The <span class="member">Flags</span> in this structure are the same as for 
  the documented <span class="struct">POWER_ACTION_POLICY</span>. They take their 
  values from the documented set of macro definitions such as
  <span class="constant">POWER_ACTION_QUERY_ALLOWED</span> through to
  <span class="constant">POWER_ACTION_CRITICAL</span>. </p>
  <p>The byte at offset 0x10 in the early versions is provided for output when the
  <span class="member">PowerStateTask</span> was set to 2 for input. In these versions, 
  this value for the <span class="member">PowerStateTask</span> directs the called 
  routine to query applications and services for permission to proceed with suspending 
  power. A non-zero byte at offset 0x10 on output means that permission has been 
  refused. </p>
  <p>It is here thought that the called routine is not permitted to change any members, 
  except as noted in the preceding paragraph. When the kernel progresses through 
  multiple calls for different values of the <span class="member">PowerStateTask</span>, 
  it does not reload any of the other members. </p>
