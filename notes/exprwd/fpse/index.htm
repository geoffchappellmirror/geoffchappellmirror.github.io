  <h1>FrontPage Server Extensions </h1>
  <p>In any assessment of <a href="../index.htm">Expression Web</a>, a special place 
  must be reserved for the mess that Microsoft has made over the FrontPage Server 
  Extensions (FPSE). These are a set of executables, or perhaps scripts in non-Windows 
  implementations, that run on a web server. Microsoft’s own brief summary of what 
  the FPSE are for is: </p>
  <blockquote>
    Enables authoring and administration of websites with Microsoft FrontPage and 
    Visual InterDev
  </blockquote>
  <p>This description comes from the Windows Components Wizard in Windows 2000, 
  Windows XP and Windows Server 2003, which all include the FPSE as a separately 
  installable feature of the Internet Information Services (IIS). Installing the 
  IIS gets you a web server with at least a Default Web Site. If you have installed 
  the FPSE as well, then the IIS Manager (among the Administrative Tools) provides 
  you with an easy way to configure the server extensions for your web sites.
  </p>
  <p>Unsurprisingly, the FPSE are also supplied with FrontPage. Most notably, FrontPage 
  2002 supplies the FrontPage 2002 Server Extensions as an update for the FrontPage 
  2000 Server Extensions that may already be present if installing on Windows 2000 
  or Windows XP. The FrontPage 2002 CD also contains, in a separate directory with 
  its own setup program, something called Windows SharePoint Services (version 2.1), 
  which is notable here because it also includes the executables of the FrontPage 
  2002 Server Extensions. For the purposes of this note,
  <a href="sharepoint.htm">Windows SharePoint Services</a> are FrontPage Server 
  Extensions by another name. </p>
  <p>The FrontPage Server Extensions are not supplied with Windows Vista and are 
  not supplied with Expression Web. Microsoft distributes the Windows SharePoint 
  Services (version 3.0 Service Pack 1 as late as December 2008) as a free download, 
  but the package does not install on Windows Vista. At least for users of Windows 
  Vista, the FrontPage Server Extensions seem to have had their day. </p>
  <h2>Standards Compliance </h2>
  <p>Some would say the FrontPage Server Extensions would better have never been 
  introduced. On some grounds, they would have a good point. The FPSE are not solely 
  about using HTTP for authoring and administration. They also support, and are 
  needed for, some of the design-time aids that FrontPage calls Web Components. 
  In a typical case, the design-time coding is an HTML comment whose text is to 
  be interpreted by the server and resolved as HTML code that is downloaded to browsers. 
  Such server-side HTML generation is not of itself objectionable. Indeed, it’s 
  well-established in a variety of forms and seems to be widely valued. The trouble 
  is that for some of these Web Components, the HTML code that the FPSE generates 
  at the server and sends to the browser is non-standard. </p>
  <p>Of course, this trouble might be resolved easily enough by fixing the FPSE 
  so that the generated code is standards-compliant. If Microsoft has not wanted 
  to do this, then that is Microsoft’s perogative, but it is strange from a company 
  that has usually attended well to issues of compatibility. At Microsoft’s encouragement, 
  the FrontPage Server Extensions are by now depended on for the correct working 
  of very many websites that have been written using FrontPage. The FPSE are installed 
  not only on the machines of FrontPage users but also on countless servers operated 
  by the providers of web-hosting services. Perhaps what Microsoft really dislikes 
  is that many of those servers do not run Windows. Is it too cynical to suppose 
  it might suit Microsoft much better if FrontPage users who presently publish to 
  Linux servers that run FrontPage Server Extensions should evolve into Expression 
  Web users who expect their web-hosting services to provide ASP .NET on Windows 
  servers? </p>
  <h2>Expression Web </h2>
  <p>The Expression Web Help says very little about the FrontPage Server Extensions. 
  This seems odd to me, since much of what the Expression Web Help says you can 
  do with websites is impossible if the website is accessed through an HTTP address 
  but does not have the FrontPage Server Extensions. Consider for instance the page
  <span class="citation">Publishing Websites</span>. It offers several “publishing 
  scenarios”, each of which I quote: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>work on your own computer and then publish your changes to a remote production 
    web server; </li>
    <li>work on a remote staging web server and publish your changes to a remote 
    production web server; </li>
    <li>work directly on a remote production web server. </li>
  </ul>
  <p>There is no suggestion of any dependence on the FrontPage Server Extensions, 
  yet if the remote web server, whether for staging or production, is to be accessed 
  as a web server through an HTTP address, then it must have the FrontPage Server 
  Extensions. This is known to the Expression Web programmers, as is perfectly plain 
  from the following message box, so how does Microsoft omit to mention it in the 
  Expression Web Help? </p>
  <img alt="Unable to open Web site" src="_images/unabletoopen.jpg" width="507" height="151">
  <p>Worse, this fairly informative message box is not what greets you in practice 
  if you think to open a web site that doesn’t have the FrontPage Server Extensions. 
  Due to coding problems, you are told instead that <a href="opensite.htm">The Folder 
  Name Is Not Valid</a>. As an explanation, that is so extremely and obviously unhelpful 
  that one must wonder how the Expression Web programmers and testers can have tolerated 
  it if they ever saw it. Perhaps they simply closed their minds to the possibility 
  that users who have migrated from FrontPage would think to enter an HTTP address 
  for a web server. </p>
  <h3>Disk-Based Webs </h3>
  <p>Of course, there are other ways to open a website in Expression Web on Windows 
  Vista. Those “publishing scenarios” that I quote above are each possible without 
  the FPSE. It’s just that you can’t open the websites by using HTTP addresses. 
  For your local website, you are instead reduced to using what the FrontPage documentation 
  refers to dismissively as a disk-based web. </p>
