  <h1>Kernel Versions </h1>
  <p>The NT Operating System Kernel (NTOSKRNL) is the defining module of the whole 
  Windows architecture. This note is specifically about the different versions of 
  the kernel as a file on disk. The generality of <a href="../../versions.htm">Windows 
  version numbering</a> is treated separately. </p>
  <h2>32-Bit Windows (x86) </h2>
  <p>The kernel is distributed with each 32-bit Windows package in as many as four 
  files: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>NTOSKRNL.EXE, single-processor without PAE; </li>
    <li>NTKRNLMP.EXE, multi-processor without PAE; </li>
    <li>NTKRNLPA.EXE, single-processor with PAE; </li>
    <li>NTKRPAMP.EXE, multi-processor with PAE. </li>
  </ul>
  <p>This multiplicity is even without the complication of free and checked builds. 
  The latter are offered by Microsoft as an aid to debugging and since they are 
  explicitly not for real-world use they are all but ignored at this website.
  </p>
  <p>PAE stands for Physical Address Extension. It applies only to 32-bit (x86) 
  builds. The point to having separate builds for PAE is that the memory manager 
  is specialised to use 32-bit or 64-bit page table entries. This is not a choice 
  that will change mid-flight and so the loaded kernel is better to have code for 
  only one or the other, not both. In many versions, users can make the choice at 
  boot time, through the <span class="switch">/PAE</span> and
  <span class="switch">/NOPAE</span> switches in BOOT.INI or the
  <span class="bcdopt">
  <a href="../../../../../notes/windows/boot/bcd/osloader/pae.htm">pae</a></span> 
  option in the Boot Configuration Data (BCD). Later versions also allow indirectly 
  for selection of the PAE kernel to be forced by a <span class="switch">/NOEXECUTE</span> 
  switch or <span class="bcdopt">
  <a href="../../../../../notes/windows/boot/bcd/osloader/nx.htm">nx</a></span> 
  option. </p>
  <p>An installed system has either the single-processor kernels or the multi-processor 
  kernels but not both. If the multi-processor kernels are installed, they are renamed 
  to NTOSKRNL.EXE and NTKRNLPA.EXE as if for a single-processor system. Starting 
  with version 6.2, an installed system has only the multi-processor PAE kernel, 
  already renamed to NTOSKRNL.EXE. </p>
  <p>Put another way, the kernel’s standard name is NTOSKRNL.EXE, except that where 
  the kernel may be installed both with and without support for PAE, the kernel 
  has the two standard names NTOSKRNL.EXE and NTKRNLPA.EXE. In the versions that 
  install both, the loader has the two standard names hard-coded. All versions can 
  be directed to load an alternative as specified by a <span class="switch">/KERNEL</span> 
  switch or <span class="bcdopt">
  <a href="../../../../../notes/windows/boot/bcd/osloader/kernel.htm">kernel</a></span> 
  option. </p>
  <h3>Builds </h3>
  <!--webbot bot="Include" U-Include="../../_include/builds.htm" TAG="BODY" startspan -->

<p>The following 32-bit (x86) builds have been inspected for these notes. Most are 
from MSDN discs. Some, especially since Microsoft greatly reduced its shipment of 
operating systems on MSDN discs, are from service packs downloaded (typically as 
self-extracting executables) from a Microsoft website. </p>
<p>Special mention must be made of the very oldest builds. Even among the many discs 
that I retain from MSDN subscriptions in the 1990s, what was then the new Windows 
that is entirely its own operating system rather than a large DOS program goes no 
further back than Windows NT 3.51. For all practical effect, Microsoft informally 
disowned the early versions, even for its so-called Archive editions. For decades 
I had little choice but to treat Windows NT 3.51 as the dawn of time for these notes. 
In 2017 someone pointed me to an online collection of earlier builds. The sample 
is inevitably incomplete. The provenance is unknown. I have since sought more: the
<a href="https://winworldpc.com/home">WinWorld</a> online museum is notable. </p>
<p>Builds are arranged in increasing order of the file version as recorded in the 
executable’s resources. This version number is readily visible using Windows Explorer 
either in a so-called infotip for the file or by accessing the Version tab in the 
Properties dialog for the file. Programmers know this version number as coming from 
the so-called root block of the version-information resource, specifically from 
the <span class="member">dwFileVersionMS</span> and <span class="member">dwFileVersionLS</span> 
members of a <span class="struct">VS_FIXEDFILEINFO</span> structure. </p>
<p>The date stamp shown for each version is more obscure. File dates are easily 
modified after the executable is built and are anyway liable to be shown differently 
when read from different time zones. However, there is in each executable’s header 
a date stamp which is set when the executable is built and which is not commonly 
changed afterwards. It is readily accessible to anyone with programming knowledge 
and appropriate tools, e.g., Microsoft’s own DUMPBIN utility. </p>
<p>Any study worth making of Windows—and please remember that the list below exists 
only as a catalogue of which builds are studied—is much too intensive to cover pre-release 
builds, hot fixes and other updates. Access to pre-release builds anyway tends to 
come with constraints and compromise that other researchers may tolerate (and even 
be happy with) but which I do not. None of this work is done with any sort of assistance 
from Microsoft beyond the binaries, as published by the tens and even hundreds of 
millions, and the same documentation that’s available to all Windows programmers.
</p>

<!--webbot bot="Include" endspan i-checksum="4283" -->
  <p>The kernel files for each build are listed in the order: NTOSKRNL.EXE, NTKRNLMP.EXE, 
  NTKRNLPA.EXE, NTKRPAMP.EXE. Not all versions have all four. Versions before 5.0 
  have only NTOSKRNL.EXE and NTKRNLMP.EXE. Versions from 6.0 onwards are built with 
  both single-processor and multi-processor kernels in the same pattern as for earlier 
  versions, but the installation image on the distribution media has only the multi-processor 
  kernels, and these are already renamed to NTOSKRNL.EXE and NTKRNLPA.EXE. Version 
  6.2 and higher have only the multi-processor PAE kernel, already renamed to NTOSKRNL.EXE.

  <p>Where two or more Windows packages are listed for a set of files, as with service 
  packs 2 and 3 of Windows NT 3.51, the files with the same name in each package 
  are the same, byte for byte. </p>
  <p>Service-pack holdings are complete starting with version 4.0. That Windows 
  200 SP2 is omitted is because a self-extracting executable has been inspected 
  for these notes but no kernels were found. </p>
  <p>Each kernel in Windows Server 2008 is the same as in Windows Vista SP1, byte 
  for byte. Similar correspondence between client and server editions of later Windows 
  versions is so much expected that the server editions are not tracked explicitly 
  for any of this study’s other pages. </p>
  <p>How or why Microsoft gets the date stamps in the kernels from later releases 
  of Windows 10 to be so obviously invalid is not yet understood. No, a few scraps 
  tossed from a Microsoft blog do not count as how or why. </p>
  <p>The 1909 release of Windows 10 was given its own place in the succession of 
  roughly biannual updates named for year and month, but it has nothing like the 
  significance of other such updates which each increased the build number by several 
  hundred or even thousands. The 1909 release is listed here only because Microsoft 
  presented it as a significant update. <span class="highlight">All the pages of 
  this study of the Windows kernel treat the 1909 release as a minor bug-fix update 
  of the 1903 release.</span> </p>
  <h2>64-Bit Windows (x64) </h2>
  <!--webbot bot="Include" U-Include="../../_include/x64builds.htm" TAG="BODY" startspan -->

<p>Microsoft’s distribution of 64-bit Windows on MSDN discs in the early years was 
even less reliable than was my renewal of subscriptions. I seem never to have received 
a 64-bit edition of Windows XP, which is therefore not included in this study. (I 
suspect anyway that it was a build of version 5.2, i.e., of Windows Server 2003, 
rebadged for better marketing.) Though correspondents tell me that 64-bit Windows 
Vista was readily available the moment that Windows Vista was released, my experience 
is instead that a year-long MSDN subscription in 2007 produced no x64 build of the 
original Windows Vista. The copy inspected of that is instead from an OEM disc. 
Though all service-pack builds that have been inspected for this study have been 
available through MSDN subscriptions, some of the copies studied have instead been 
downloaded as self-extracting executables from Microsoft’s free websites since, 
for who knows what reason, it frequently happened that the MSDN site that I paid 
to access was intolerably slow—not that my tolerance was high, especially while 
Microsoft was at the time not just leaving me to the tedium of burning disks and 
labelling them, but telling me that their purpose was to be environmentally friendly.
</p>

<!--webbot bot="Include" endspan i-checksum="40903" -->
  <p>Some Microsoft documentation, e.g., of the <span class="function">KeAcquireSpinLockRaiseToDpc</span> 
  function, talks of “64-bit versions of Windows 2000” but I certainly never received 
  any such thing from MSDN subscriptions at the time and I don’t believe the MSDN 
  site has ever listed such things even as being available to download. These notes 
  are anyway just for the amd64 processor architecture, also commonly referred to 
  as x64. Though early versions of Windows were small enough for the distribution 
  media to have binaries for multiple processor architectures and later versions 
  were supplied on separate media, I was never interested. I do still have them 
  from MSDN subscriptions, but I have no intention of listing them. </p>
  <p>The kernels for each build are listed in the order NTOSKRNL.EXE and then NTKRNLMP.EXE, 
  but only version 5.2 has both. Versions from 6.0 onwards are built with both single-processor 
  and multi-processor kernels, but the installation image on the distribution media 
  has only a multi-processor kernel, which is already renamed to NTOSKRNL.EXE.
