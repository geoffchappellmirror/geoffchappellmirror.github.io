<h1>Object Files </h1>
<p>DUMPBIN recognises three types of object file: </p>
<ul>
  <li>import object </li>
  <li>anonymous object </li>
  <li>COFF object </li>
</ul>
<p>An import object and an anonymous object both begin similarly, with 
structures that Microsoft defines symbolically (in the WINNT.H header from the 
Platform SDK) as <span class="struct">IMPORT_OBJECT_HEADER</span> and <span class="struct">
ANON_OBJ_HEADER</span> 
respectively. For both file types, the first and second words (<span class="member">Sig1</span> 
and <span class="member">Sig2</span>) must be zero and 0xFFFF respectively. The 
third word (<span class="member">Version</span>) is zero for an import object 
and one for an anonymous object. A COFF object begins with an <span class="struct">
IMAGE_FILE_HEADER</span>, in which the first and second words have meanings that 
are not usefully satisfied by zero and 0xFFFF. </p>
<h2>Import Objects </h2>
<p>DUMPBIN recognises as an import object any file whose size is at least 0x14 
bytes and whose first three words are 0x0000, 0xFFFF and 0x0000 respectively. </p>
<p>However, DUMPBIN also checks that the word at offset 0x12 decomposes 
plausibly into the expected bit fields. To fail this check means that the file 
type is identified but the file is rejected immediately as “invalid or corrupt”. 
It is a fatal error (LNK1197) for <span class="member">Type</span> to exceed 2. 
It is a fatal error (LNK1198) for <span class="member">NameType</span> to exceed 
3. It is a fatal error (LNK1199) if <span class="member">Reserved</span> is 
non-zero. </p>
<h2>Anonymous Objects </h2>
<p>DUMPBIN recognises as an anonymous object any file whose size is at least 
0x14 bytes and whose first three words are 0x0000, 0xFFFF and 0x0001 
respectively.
</p>
<h2>COFF Objects </h2>
<p>DUMPBIN recognises as a COFF object any file that plausibly begins with an
<span class="struct">IMAGE_FILE_HEADER</span>. The file size must be at least 
0x14 bytes, the first word must be a supported type of <span class="member">
Machine</span> 
and, unless the first word is zero, the second word must be not wildly 
implausible as a <span class="member">NumberOfSections</span>. </p>
<p>However, the checks have very different consequences, if failed. If the first 
word is not zero but the second word is 0xFF00 or greater, the consequence is a 
fatal error (LNK1136), with the file described as “invalid or corrupt”. If the 
first word is not one of the following, </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>0x0000, 0x014C, 0x0162, 0x0166, 0x0168, 0x01A2, 0x01A3, 0x01A6, 0x01A8, 
  0x01C0, 0x01C2, 0x01D3, 0x01F0, 0x01F1, 0x0200, 0x0266, 0x0366, 0x0466, 
  0x0520, 0x8664 and 0x9041, </p>
</blockquote>
<p>the consequence is just that the file is not recognised as any sort of object 
file. </p>
