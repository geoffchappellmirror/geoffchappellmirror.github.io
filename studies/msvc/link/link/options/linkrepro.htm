<h1>LINK /LINKREPRO </h1>
<p>This option sets a directory for <a href="../../repro.htm">test-case 
reproduction</a>.
</p>
<!--webbot bot="Include" U-Include="../../_include/linkrepro-syntax.htm" TAG="BODY" startspan -->

<h2>Syntax </h2>
<blockquote>
  <p><span class="switch">/linkrepro:</span><span class="placeholder">path</span><span class="switch">
  </span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The assumed <span class="placeholder">path</span> argument consists of everything 
after the colon. By “assumed”, it is meant here that the code that does the parsing 
does not check whether the option extends as far as including a
<span class="placeholder">path</span>.&nbsp; Indeed, the colon is assumed too, and 
may in fact be replaced by any single character. Since these assumptions are almost 
certainly coding errors, the syntax is shown above as if
<span class="placeholder">path</span> is required. </p>
<p>The form <span class="switch">/?linkrepro</span>, with the usually inconsequential 
question mark, is not recognised and causes a warning (LNK4044). </p>

<!--webbot bot="Include" i-checksum="11251" endspan -->
<p>The <span class="switch">/linkrepro</span> option is for the command line 
only. It is not valid as a directive in an object file. </p>
<!--webbot bot="Include" U-Include="../../_include/linkrepro-behaviour.htm" TAG="BODY" startspan -->

<h2>Behaviour </h2>
<p>The <span class="placeholder">path</span> argument names a directory that is 
to receive copies of all input files and also a text file that records what was 
asked. The idea is that whatever was done can be reproduced by re-running with this 
“repro” directory as the current directory. Reproduction by other hands is made 
easier because the contents of this directory may be sent as one package. </p>
<p>The command line, including expansions from environment variables and command 
files, is searched for <span class="switch">/linkrepro</span> (and
<span class="switch">/libpath</span>) options in an early pass, so that test-case 
reproduction will be active even for options that precede any
<span class="switch">/linkrepro</span>. </p>
