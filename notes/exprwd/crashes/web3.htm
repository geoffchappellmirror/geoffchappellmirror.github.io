  <h1>Expression Web 3 Crashes Often </h1>
  <p>That the original <a href="index.htm">Expression Web crashed often</a> in my 
  ordinary use of it is documented separately. It would have been naive to expect 
  that upgrading to Expression Web 3 would bring much change. Indeed, I feared the 
  worst when I crashed the program within hours of purchase, as described on the 
  page <a href="styleapplication.htm">Expression Web 3 crashes when enabling Manual 
  Style Application while no page is open</a>, but the coding error responsible 
  for that one was as easily found as it may have been easily written. Prepared 
  to excuse that crash as unfortunate but known and avoidable, I set about putting 
  the new software to use for this website. </p>
  <p>For the first couple of months, my use of the new version was barely more than 
  occasional and anyway very light, but once I started using the new version as 
  often and as heavily as I had been using the original version a year before, the 
  crashes started to come thick and fast. Clearly, I use the product in some way 
  that doesn’t get tested much. Perhaps it’s my use of subsites (which, though supported 
  in the user interface, are obscure enough not to have any mention in the product’s 
  help files). Perhaps my subsites have too many pages or I sometimes have too many 
  open at once. Perhaps I use the Include Page feature too heavily and ought not 
  nest the inclusions. Who’s to know, but I am anyway disinclined to generosity 
  to the writers of this software: as demonstrated on the several pages I have yet 
  written about <a href="../bugs/index.htm">Expression Web bugs</a>, this software 
  has numerous problems just of basic functionality even when working with the initially 
  opened blank page of a fresh installation. This really is wretched software, especially 
  considering that it comes from the world’s largest manufacturer, who most has 
  the resources to get basic things right. They don’t look to be trying very hard 
  for Expression Web. </p>
  <p>Of course, I didn’t buy Expression Web as a case study in defective software. 
  I bought it as a tool for the real work of writing up results (of other research) 
  for publication at a website. When Expression Web crashes, I sometimes attach 
  a debugger to see if the crash is amenable to a quick explanation. But since most 
  of the crashes occur deep in a very large DLL for which I don’t even have public 
  symbols, it’s usually very clear very soon that the time needed for investigation 
  would be seriously disruptive of the work that I bought the program to help me 
  with. The best it seems I shall be able to do is catalogue the crashes, so that 
  at least some public record can be found by anyone who wonders if they are alone 
  in finding that Expression Web crashes often. </p>
  <h2>Catalogue </h2>
  <p>All the crashes that I record on this page occurred in the ExpressionWeb.exe 
  process, running on 32-bit Windows Vista SP1. The ExpressionWeb.exe version is 
  3.0.3813.0, from Expression Web 3 SP1. </p>
  <h3>FPEDITAX </h3>
  <p>Arguably the largest component of Expression Web is the DLL that acts as the 
  Microsoft Expression Web Editor. Its name, FPEDITAX.DLL, recalls its origins as 
  the Microsoft FrontPage Editor. </p>
  <p>Crashes have been reported from FPEDITAX at offsets 0x0001050E (nine times), 
  0x00084C6F (twice) and 0x001239A6 (twice). </p>
  <p>The repeated crashes at offset 0x0001050E tend to occur while opening a file. 
  My feeling is of some connection to my use of Include Pages, particularly as preparation 
  of new Include Pages was part of the work at the time. The crashes were sometimes 
  not long preceded by Expression Web’s failure to resolve one or more Include Pages. 
  For the record, four of these crashes occurred during a few days while working 
  on the page <a href="../../../studies/windows/win32/apisetschema/index.htm">ApiSetSchema</a> 
  and its few dozen companions which share content from a dozen Include Pages.
  </p>
  <p>The crash at offset 0x001239A6 recurred on the same day, after a reboot, just 
  while typing text in the same set of files as for the first occurrence. Additionally, 
  over several days of working on these particular files, the program restarted 
  seven times. By that I mean that it looked hung for a few seconds but then recovered 
  (with a new position on the taskbar). I believe that those are yet more crashes, 
  just not ones the user is alerted to. A pattern is developing for these: they 
  seem most likely when switching to Design view from Code view. The files concerned 
  are distinctive for having very large tables. The cells contain nothing but text, 
  never more than a few short lines, but there are thousands of rows. For an example, 
  see <a href="../../../studies/windows/win32/ntdll/api/index.htm">NTDLL Exports</a>. 
  Even without crashing, something clearly is very wrong with how Expression Web 
  (and FrontPage before it) handles tables: in Design View, the simple act of typing 
  in so large a table can take seconds for each character. </p>
  <h3>Protocols </h3>
  <p>Three crashes have been reported from Protocols.dll, at offsets 0x0005EA17 
  (twice), 0x0005EA1A and 0x0006B0E3. Curiously, two of these occurred while Windows 
  Error Reporting was running because of a fault in another ExpressionWeb.exe process. 
  (In Expression Web 3, the windows for multiple sites, including subsites, are 
  each in their own process.) </p>
  <h2>Crash Dumps </h2>
  <p>After complaining at the Microsoft Connect website, asking what Microsoft offers 
  that is at all constructive for users who find its software defective, and including 
  to offer that I’ll do the debugging myself if Microsoft will lighten the load 
  by publishing relevant symbol files, I have been asked by Microsoft (in the person 
  of Jim Cheshire) to capture crash dumps so that Microsoft can do the debugging. 
  Quite why Windows Error Reporting never itself captures such files to send to 
  Microsoft when Expression Web 3 crashes is a mystery to me. (It did save them 
  for some crashes of the original Expression Web, though I believe it never went 
  so far as to send them to Microsoft.) Still, given that someone may look at dump 
  files for these crashes, it’s no trouble to create them for each new crash and 
  link to them from here. </p>
