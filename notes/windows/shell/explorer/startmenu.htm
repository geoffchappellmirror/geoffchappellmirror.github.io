  <h1>The Start Menu’s Start </h1>
  <p>Windows XP brought a new look to the Start Menu. The previous style, which 
  users can revert to, is now known as the Classic Start Menu. An apparent detraction 
  of the latter is that finding a shortcut on the Start Menu is necessarily an exercise 
  in navigating cascading menus, which can each be large enough to require scrolling. 
  The new style of Start Menu lets users go through the cascading menus if they 
  want, but it also tracks the most frequently used shortcuts and presents them 
  separately for easy access, in a pane on the left of the menu: </p>
  <a href="_images/start.png">
  <img class="HiFi" alt="Start Menu for New User of Windows Vista Ultimate" src="_images/start.jpg" width="308" height="428"></a>
  <p>This left pane is in three sections, separated by horizontal dividers. In the 
  middle are shortcuts that come and go according to an assessment of how often 
  and how recently they have been used. The context menu for any shortcut in this 
  section provides an easy way to pin the shortcut to the list so that it remains 
  handy even if it does not stay among the most frequently used. Such pinned shortcuts 
  go to the top section. At the bottom of the pane is the means to work your way 
  through the cascading menus of all the shortcuts from the Programs folder of the 
  Start Menu. </p>
  <p>As with the Classic Start Menu, the new style of Start Menu is highly configurable: 
  at the menu itself; through the “Taskbar and Start Menu Properties” dialog; through 
  the “Start Menu and Taskbar” administrative template in the Group Policy Object 
  Editor; and, inevitably, through undocumented registry values. </p>
  <h2>The Initial Shortcuts </h2>
  <p>For a new user, whether because Windows is newly installed or because the user 
  is first logging on to a newly created account, the Start Menu typically already 
  shows both pinned shortcuts and most frequently used shortcuts even though no 
  shortcuts have yet been used. The picture above shows such a list for a new user 
  of Windows Vista Ultimate. </p>
  <p>Though these initial shortcuts may soon drop from the list and can easily be 
  removed deliberately, the programs they refer to begin with a high profile: the 
  Start Menu is among the main ways that new users find out what’s in Windows. These 
  programs include some that are written by Microsoft but have competitors that 
  are written by others. Some manufacturers, and users, of such competing programs 
  object to Microsoft using its ownership of Windows to arrange so advantageous 
  a promotion of Microsoft’s programs. They say this is unfair competition in a 
  supposedly open market of all applications that run on Windows. </p>
  <p>To help an informed assessment of such concerns, this article describes where 
  the initial list of Start Menu shortcuts comes from. This information in turn 
  tells how an Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) can configure the appearance 
  of the initial list when a pre-installed Windows is first used and how an administrator 
  can configure it for when a user first logs on to a newly created account. It 
  also, of course, notes how limited is this configurability. </p>
  <h2>The Pinned List </h2>
  <p>Filling the pinned list is the work of SHELL32 (or, more precisely, of whichever 
  DLL implements the <span class="class">
  <a href="../../../../studies/windows/shell/shell32/classes/startmenupin.htm">StartMenuPin</a></span> 
  class). </p>
  <p>SHELL32 allows that the pinned list can be disabled by administrative policy. 
  If the following registry value (in either of two keys, listed here in decreasing 
  order of precedence) evaluates as non-zero, then SHELL32 treats the pinned list 
  as empty: </p>
  <table class="Registry">
    <tr>
      <td>Key: </td>
      <td><span class="regkey">HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\Explorer</span>
      <br>
      <span class="regkey">HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\Explorer</span>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Value: </td>
      <td><span class="regvalue">NoStartMenuPinnedList</span> </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Type: </td>
      <td><span class="constant">REG_DWORD</span> </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Default: </td>
      <td>0 </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  <p>The <span class="regvalue">NoStartMenuPinnedList</span> value has user-interface 
  support through the Group Policy Object Editor, as “Remove pinned programs list 
  from the Start Menu” in the “Start Menu and Taskbar” administrative template.
  </p>
  <p>Ordinarily, the pinned list is not disabled and has been populated in an earlier 
  session and remembered in the registry: </p>
  <table class="Registry">
    <tr>
      <td>Key: </td>
      <td><span class="regkey">HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\StartPage</span>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Value: </td>
      <td><span class="regvalue">Favorites</span> </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  <p>The data is a series of variably-sized entries. Each begins with a one-byte 
  CSIDL, which represents a special folder location. For instance, 0x00 represents 
  the desktop folder. Provided that the CSIDL is not 0xFF, the entry then continues 
  as a dword and an <span class="struct">ITEMIDLIST</span> (commonly called a PIDL). 
  The dword gives the size, in bytes, of the PIDL that comes after it. </p>
  <p>If this <span class="regvalue">Favorites</span> value does not exist or its 
  data is empty, as will be typical for a new user, SHELL32 seeds the list from 
  defaults. The choice of defaults depends on the <span class="regvalue">ServerAdminUI</span> 
  value: </p>
  <table class="Registry">
    <tr>
      <td>Key: </td>
      <td><span class="regkey">HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\Advanced</span>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Value: </td>
      <td><span class="regvalue">ServerAdminUI</span> </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  <p>EXPLORER sets this value when first executing as the shell for a new user. 
  The data is 1 if the Windows installation is a server and the user has sufficient 
  privilege, else 0. Most users, of course, are not administrators of server installations, 
  and this value ordinarily starts as zero. (It may very usefully be changed as 
  early as possible by a new user, but that is another story.) In this ordinary 
  case, the pinned shortcuts are initialised from hard-coded defaults: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>shell:::{2559a1f4-21d7-11d4-bdaf-00c04f60b9f0} </li>
    <li>shell:::{2559a1f5-21d7-11d4-bdaf-00c04f60b9f0} </li>
  </ul>
  <p>These unusual-looking things are paths in the shell namespace such as may be 
  fed to the <span class="command">start</span> command or the
  <span class="function">ShellExecute</span> function. They identify shell objects 
  that represent respectively the default web browser and the default e-mail client. 
  Implementation details are given separately, with directions to
  <a href="../clienticons.htm">Create a Desktop Icon for the Default Web Browser</a>.
  </p>
  <p>In the much less ordinary case where <span class="regvalue">ServerAdminUI</span> 
  is initially non-zero, the defaults for the pinned shortcuts come from SHELL32 
  string resources else from hard-coding: </p>
  <table>
    <tr>
      <th>Resource ID </th>
      <th>Hard-Coded Default </th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>31,168 </td>
      <td>%ProgramData%\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Administrative Tools\Server 
      Manager.lnk </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>31,169 </td>
      <td>%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Accessories\Command 
      Prompt.lnk </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  <h2>The MFU List </h2>
  <p>Whether EXPLORER even tries to pre-populate the MFU list for a new user is 
  subject to administrative policy, expressed through the following registry value:
  </p>
  <table class="Registry">
    <tr>
      <td>Key: </td>
      <td><span class="regkey">HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\Explorer</span>
      <br>
      <span class="regkey">HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\Explorer</span>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Value: </td>
      <td><span class="regvalue">ClearRecentProgForNewUserInStartMenu</span>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Type: </td>
      <td><span class="constant">REG_DWORD</span> or <span class="constant">REG_BINARY</span>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Default: </td>
      <td>0 </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  <p>This setting has user-interface support through the Group Policy Object Editor, 
  as “Clear the recent programs list for new users” in the “Start Menu and Taskbar” 
  administrative template. The 4 bytes of data are evaluated as 0 for false and 
  1 for true. Anything else is an error and is defaulted to false. </p>
  <p>Unless this registry setting evaluates as true, EXPLORER seeds the list of 
  most frequently used shortcuts. This MFU list is maintained with help from BROWSEUI 
  (or, more precisely, of whichever DLL implements the <span class="class">
  <a href="../../../../studies/windows/ie/browseui/classes/userassist.htm">UserAssist</a></span> 
  class), most notably for persistent storage for assessing the frequency of use. 
  Attention here is just with the records that EXPLORER enters into that persistent 
  storage to get the MFU list started. Much more, including more registry configuration, 
  is involved in how EXPLORER later draws from this storage to display the MFU list, 
  but this is all left for another article. </p>
  <p>EXPLORER seeds the MFU list with as many as eight shortcuts. These are chosen 
  from two sources: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>a specification that seems intended for use by OEMs (but may also be useful 
    to administrators); </li>
    <li>hard-coded lists that vary with the Windows product type. </li>
  </ul>
  <p>An additional factor in the choice is to avoid reproducing shortcuts that are 
  anyway in the pinned list. No shortcut is accepted for the initial MFU list if 
  its target is already the target of any of the first three shortcuts from the 
  pinned list. </p>
  <h3>OEM Shortcuts </h3>
  <p>Positions 5 to 8 of the initial MFU list are configurable from the registry:
  </p>
  <table class="Registry">
    <tr>
      <td>Key: </td>
      <td><span class="regkey">HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\SMDEn</span>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Value: </td>
      <td><span class="regvalue">OEM0</span> for 5th shortcut <br>
      <span class="regvalue">OEM1</span> for 6th shortcut <br>
      <span class="regvalue">OEM2</span> for 7th shortcut <br>
      <span class="regvalue">OEM3</span> for 8th shortcut </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  <p>Data for each value is interpreted as an indirect string in the sense of the 
  undocumented function <span class="function">
  <a href="../../../../studies/windows/shell/shlwapi/api/regw/loadreguistring.htm">
  SHLoadRegUIString</a></span>. Thus, the data may itself be a pathname for the 
  shortcut, or it may specify a resource ID from which to load the pathname. Either 
  way, the pathname is allowed environment variables. For the purpose of entering 
  into the MFU list, this pathname can be anything in the shell namespace. In practice 
  however, only pathnames to Start Menu shortcuts are later retrieved for display.
  </p>
  <h4>Example </h4>
  <p>For the following snapshot, an administrator has installed the media player 
  known as QuickTime before Windows is first started by the intended user. Alternatively, 
  QuickTime has been pre-installed by an OEM. Either way, QuickTime has created 
  a shortcut for the Start Menu. With this shortcut’s pathname as the data for the
  <span class="regvalue">OEM0</span> value: </p>
  <table class="Registry">
    <tr>
      <td>Key: </td>
      <td><span class="regkey">HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\SMDEn</span>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Value: </td>
      <td><span class="regvalue">OEM0</span> </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Type: </td>
      <td><span class="constant">REG_EXPAND_SZ</span> </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Data: </td>
      <td>%ProgramData%\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\QuickTime\QuickTime 
      Player.lnk </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  <p>QuickTime appears on the Start Menu for all new users (at the highest position 
  allowed by this method of configuration): </p>
  <a href="_images/start_quicktime.png">
  <img class="HiFi" alt="Initial Start Menu With QuickTime Set By OEM" src="_images/start_quicktime.jpg" width="308" height="428"></a>
  <h3>Built-In Shortcuts </h3>
  <p>Positions that are not filled from the <span class="regvalue">OEM<span class="placeholder">n</span></span> 
  values are filled from lists that are hard-coded into EXPLORER.EXE. There are 
  27 such lists in the EXPLORER version 6.00 from the original Windows Vista. Mostly, 
  there is one list for each supported type of Windows product (in the sense documented 
  for the <span class="function">GetProductInfo</span> function). The Home Premium 
  and Ultimate product types each have two lists, for when touch-screen support 
  is or is not available. </p>
  <p>In the descriptions that follow, each shortcut is given by the name of the 
  shortcut file. The display name in the Start Menu can be different, as with Windows 
  Live Messenger Download for “Windows Live.lnk” and Windows Meeting Space for “Windows 
  Collaboration.lnk”. The locations have placeholders for special folders. The following 
  table shows a typical resolution using environment variables: </p>
  <table>
    <tr>
      <td><span class="placeholder">CommonPrograms</span> </td>
      <td>%ProgramData%\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>

      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  <h4>Home and Ultimate </h4>
  <p>The product types that sell in by far the greatest numbers are Home Basic, 
  Home Premium and Ultimate. The lists for these are broadly similar: </p>

  <h4>Business </h4>
  <p>The Business edition is also encountered frequently, especially in corporate 
  environments. Its initial list has many shortcuts in common with the Home Premium 
  edition, but is not readily described in the table above since there is a change 
  of order. Windows Collaboration is placed higher, above the Windows Photo Gallery

  <p>The EXPLORER from Windows Vista SP1 adds recognition of Enterprise N, but with 
  the same list. </p>
  <h4>Starter </h4>
  <p>The Starter edition has a greatly reduced selection of bundled programs and 
  a consequently very different pre-populated list: </p>
  <table>
    <tr>
      <th>Shortcut (.lnk) </th>
      <th>Location </th>
    </tr>

  <h4>Servers </h4>
  <p>The same EXPLORER.EXE is intended for both client and server editions. The 
  EXPLORER from the original Windows Vista therefore has lists for server editions 
  even though none are known ever to have been released. All server editions have 
  the same initial list: </p>
  <table>
    <tr>
      <th>Shortcut (.lnk) </th>
      <th>Location </th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Windows Update </td>
      <td><span class="placeholder">CommonStartMenu</span> </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Internet Explorer </td>
      <td><span class="placeholder">Programs</span> </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Command Prompt </td>
      <td><span class="placeholder">Programs</span>\Accessories </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Notepad </td>
      <td><span class="placeholder">Programs</span>\Accessories </td>
    </tr>

  <h3>Priorities </h3>
  <p>Note that the initial lists for all client editions of Windows Vista have in 
  common four shortcuts: Welcome Center, Internet Explorer, Windows Media Player 
  and Windows Live. The Welcome Center is always first, as expected for a welcome.
  </p>
  <p>Internet Explorer is always second, even in the server editions. If a different 
  web browser is pre-installed by an OEM and configured to show in the MFU list 
  through an <span class="regvalue">OEM<span class="placeholder">n</span></span> 
  value, Internet Explorer will be advertised to the new user more prominently than 
  is the alternative. If the alternative is set as the default web browser for all 
  users, it will show at the top of the pinned list for each new user, but Internet 
  Explorer still gets advertised in the MFU list: </p>
  <a href="_images/start_firefox.png">
  <img class="HiFi" alt="Initial Start Menu With Different Default Web Browser" src="_images/start_firefox.jpg" width="308" height="428"></a>
  <p>The Windows Media Player also is in the top four positions in all client editions 
  except Ultimate (and Home Basic N, which does not have it), and therefore is advertised 
  more prominently than any competing product can be if configured through an
  <span class="regvalue">OEM<span class="placeholder">n</span></span> value. This 
  is true also of the Windows Media Center in the two editions that have it. </p>
  <p>It should perhaps not go unobserved that the two programs that are most subject 
  to competitive concerns have their shortcuts generated afresh for each new user. 
  See that their shortcuts are in the per-user <span class="placeholder">Programs</span> 
  folder rather than the machine-wide <span class="placeholder">CommonPrograms</span>. 
  It’s surely not without signficance, but a study of that must wait for another 
  article. </p>
