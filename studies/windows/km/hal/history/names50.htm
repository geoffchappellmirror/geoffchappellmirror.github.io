<h1>HAL Exports Added For Version 5.0 </h1>
<p>This page lists the five exports that were added to the Windows HAL for version 
5.0, i.e., for Windows 2000. They are exported only from the x86 builds. All are 
still exported as of version 10.0, but starting with version 6.2 they are exported 
only as forwards to the kernel (which is where all versions of 64-bit Windows export 
them from). </p>
<!--webbot bot="Include" U-Include="../../_include/colours.htm" TAG="BODY" startspan -->

<p>Documentation status is summarised by colour coding. <span class="NoScript">(Had 
the website’s scripts run as expected, then hovering over any colour-coded text 
would produce a tooltip that shows why the text is coloured.) </span>
<span class="ScriptOnly">(To decode a colour, hover for a tooltip.) </span></p>
<p>Functions that appear to be completely undocumented are
<span class="undocumented">highlighted yellow</span>. If a function is documented 
now but was not documented in the first contemporaneous Device Driver Kit (DDK), 
Windows Driver Kit (WDK) or Installable File System (IFS) Kit, then it is
<span class="delayed">shaded yellow</span> to retain some of its previous status. 
If a function is documented as reserved or obsolete, it is
<span class="reserved">shaded red</span> or <span class="obsolete">shaded grey</span>, 
respectively. Otherwise, functions that have their own non-trivial documentation 
are left with no background colour. </p>
<p>Many undocumented functions and some variables have C-language declarations in 
one or another header file. To show them as being not completely undocumented they 
are <span class="declared">shaded orange</span>, except for one special case. Some 
declarations are known only from “minwin” headers that Microsoft published in early 
editions of the WDK for Windows 10 which seem since to have been withdrawn. These 
are <span class="minwin">highlighted orange</span> to indicate that public disclosure 
even of the declaration was exceptional. </p>

<p>The first documentation known to this study is for the IFS Kit as included with 
the WDK for Windows Vista. Each has its own page just to say that the function is 
reserved. None of the functions is even declared in the IFS Kit for Windows 2000, 
but I cannot discount that they were documented in an IFS Kit for Windows XP (this 
having not been obtained for reference) or were at least declared. </p>
<p><a href="../../ntoskrnl/api/ke/queuelock/index.htm">Queued spin locks</a> have 
x64 support as exports from the kernel. Eventually, the x86 implementations were 
moved to the kernel too, so that the HAL itself retains no implementation. </p>
