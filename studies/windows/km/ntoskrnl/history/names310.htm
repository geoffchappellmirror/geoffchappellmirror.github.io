  <h1>Kernel Version 3.10 Exports </h1>
  <p>This page lists the 618 functions and variables that are exported from the 
  i386 (x86) build of the Windows kernel in version 3.10. It is here thought that 
  no changes were made by service packs of version 3.10, but beware that only SP3 
  has yet been obtained for inspection. </p>
  <p>Together with 69 from the contemporaneous HAL, these 618 exported functions 
  and variables are the original kernel-mode programming interface for the Windows 
  that is its own operating system (in contrast to the Windows that runs on DOS). 
  They make up nearly a fifth of all exports from the kernel over all known versions. 
  All but 37 are still exported from the i386 kernel as of Windows 10, but 60 were 
  never adopted as exports from the amd64 (x64) kernel. </p>
  <h2>Conventions </h2>
  <!--webbot bot="Include" U-Include="_include/conventions.htm" TAG="BODY" startspan -->

<p>To convey more detail with less text, the page relies heavily on several types 
of shortcut. </p>

<!--webbot bot="Include" endspan i-checksum="31086" -->
  <!--webbot bot="Include" U-Include="_include/variables.htm" TAG="BODY" startspan -->

<p>The first is that although a few of the kernel’s exports are of variables rather 
than functions, I tend to talk of all as functions, hoping that no confusion will 
be caused by the loose terminology. The variables are indicated by a parenthetical 
“data” after their name in the Functions column. </p>

<!--webbot bot="Include" endspan i-checksum="4482" -->
  <h3>Colours </h3>
  <!--webbot bot="Include" U-Include="_include/colours.htm" TAG="BODY" startspan -->

<p>Documentation status is summarised by colour coding. <span class="NoScript">(Had 
the website’s scripts run as expected, then hovering over any colour-coded text 
would produce a tooltip that shows why the text is coloured.) </span>
<span class="ScriptOnly">(To decode a colour, hover for a tooltip.) </span></p>
<p>Functions that appear to be completely undocumented are
<span class="undocumented">highlighted yellow</span>. If a function is documented 
now but was not documented in the first contemporaneous Device Driver Kit (DDK), 
Windows Driver Kit (WDK) or Installable File System (IFS) Kit, then it is
<span class="delayed">shaded yellow</span> to retain some of its previous status. 
If a function is documented as reserved or obsolete, it is
<span class="reserved">shaded red</span> or <span class="obsolete">shaded grey</span>, 
respectively. Otherwise, functions that have their own non-trivial documentation 
are left with no background colour. </p>
<p>Many undocumented functions (and some variables) have C-language declarations 
in one or another header file from one or more of Microsoft’s programming kits. 
Without meaning to suggest that the declaration counts as documentation, no matter 
that Microsoft does sometimes “document” a function just by repackaging the declaration, 
the function is <span class="declared">shaded orange</span> to distinguish it as 
not completely undocumented. </p>

<!--webbot bot="Include" endspan i-checksum="62113" -->
  <!--webbot bot="Include" U-Include="_include/minwin.htm" TAG="BODY" startspan -->

<p>A function is <span class="minwin">highlighted orange</span> for the further 
distinction that the declaration’s disclosure was limited to headers from the “minwin” 
subdirectory of the WDK for Windows 10 in its editions for the original and 1511 
versions only. Where this is marked as a function’s current documentation status, 
the understanding is that the function was undocumented before version 10.0 and 
would still be undocumented except for the exceptional disclosure in these two WDK 
editions which Microsoft seems since to have withdrawn. </p>

<!--webbot bot="Include" endspan i-checksum="3676" -->
  <h3>Actual Availability </h3>
  <!--webbot bot="Include" U-Include="_include/exporthistory.htm" TAG="BODY" startspan -->

<p>The default understanding is that exporting continues for all later versions, 
and in both the x86 and x64 builds. Exceptions are sketched in a column headed Export 
History. </p>

<!--webbot bot="Include" endspan i-checksum="64859" -->
  <!--webbot bot="Include" U-Include="_include/x86only.htm" TAG="BODY" startspan -->

<p>The description “x86 only” means that the function is not exported from any known 
x64 build but is exported from the x86 build of at least some version that has an 
x64 build. If it had already ceased as an export before Windows Server 2003 SP1, 
the “x86 only” is left unstated. </p>

<!--webbot bot="Include" endspan i-checksum="43035" -->
  <!--webbot bot="Include" U-Include="_include/discontinued.htm" TAG="BODY" startspan -->

<p>That a function is “discontinued in” some version means that the function is 
exported up to but not including the stated version and not in any later version 
unless “restored”. </p>

<!--webbot bot="Include" endspan i-checksum="31363" -->
  <h3>Documented Availability </h3>
  <!--webbot bot="Include" U-Include="_include/docdeclhistory.htm" TAG="BODY" startspan -->

<p>It’s nothing but fair to note that the majority of these functions were not documented 
immediately. Even more were then or later said to require later versions. These 
misrepresentations of actual availability show also in C-language declarations for 
the functions’ use in programming. Conveying these differences between what the 
kernel exported and what Microsoft presented for drivers to import is the concern 
of columns headed Documentation History and Declaration History. </p>
<p class="alert">Conventions still in development! </p>

<!--webbot bot="Include" endspan i-checksum="26474" -->
  <h4>Incompleteness </h4>
  <p>A few of these original functions are affected by changes to the kernel as 
  early as version 3.50. What changed immediately in the documentation or declarations 
  is presently unknown because no DDK for Windows NT 3.50 has yet been found for 
  inspection. Applicable DDK versions are left to the imprecision of “3.50 to 3.51” 
  unless a narrowing to one or the other is inferred and explained. </p>
  <!--webbot bot="Include" U-Include="_include/missingifskits.htm" TAG="BODY" startspan -->

<p>Many functions in these early versions got their first documentation or declaration 
not in the ordinary DDK but in a separate IFS Kit because their use was specially 
anticipated for installable file system (IFS) drivers. This IFS KIt had limited 
distribution, possibly under conditions of non-disclosure, before its merger into 
the WDK for Windows Vista. The IFS Kit for Windows 2000 states that it is the first 
with documentation. There are IFS Kits for Windows XP and Windows Server 2003 but 
I have not obtained either for inspection. Where applicable DDK versions are left 
to the imprecision of “5.1 (IFS) to 6.0”, whatever is described is known from the 
IFS section of the WDK for Windows Vista but is unknown to the IFS Kit for Windows 
2000 and to each ordinary DDK for Windows 2000, Windows XP and Windows Server 2003: 
it may or may not be in an IFS Kit for Windows XP or Windows Server 2003. </p>

<!--webbot bot="Include" endspan i-checksum="19837" -->
  <h2>Tabulation </h2>
  <!--webbot bot="Include" U-Include="_include/tabulation.htm" TAG="BODY" startspan -->

<p>As much as I might like to condense into one table as much as might be imagined 
is possible to summarise about each function’s history of availability both in the 
binary and according to the documentation and headers, many functions both individually 
and in groups demand additional explanation in text. I therefore break the tabulation 
according to Microsoft’s scheme of prefixes for separate areas of functionality 
within the otherwise monolithic kernel. Each function has its own row in one table, 
but please be sure to check for explanatory text before and (more usually) after 
the table. </p>

  <p>Among exported functions that are documented,
  <span class="delayed function">CcMapData</span> and
  <span class="delayed function">CcPurgeCacheSection</span> are unusual in having 
  changed their prototypes. For both, what was originally a <span class="type">BOOLEAN</span> 
  argument got widened to a <span class="type">ULONG</span> such that the value 
  1 which stood for <span class="constant">TRUE</span> becomes just one of potentially 
  many bit flags. Changes of prototype in exported functions, and especially in 
  documented functions, are rare enough that I might list each of these as two different 
  functions, except that the changes extend the interface compatibly. Still, one 
  if not both functions present the problem that the documentation did not immediately 
  note the change. </p>
  <p>For <span class="delayed function">CcMapData</span>, the change starts with 
  version 5.1. That it was documented as early as the IFS Kit for Windows XP seems 
  likely, but an error is certain: documentation in the WDK for Windows Vista, and 
  ever since, incorrectly dates the change to version 5.0. Do not miss the irony 
  that one of the WDK documentation’s few explicit acknowledgements that a function 
  existed before Windows 2000 is wrong in the detail. </p>
  <p>For <span class="delayed function">CcPurgeCacheSection</span>, the new prototype 
  applies first in version 6.0 but does not show in the documentation until version 
  6.2. </p>
  <p>The IFS Kit for Windows XP is listed above as providing the first documentation 
  of <span class="delayed function">CcGetDirtyPages</span> and
  <span class="delayed function">CcSetLogHandleForFile</span>, but this is mere 
  supposition. Neither is documented in the IFS Kit for Windows 2000. Both are documented 
  in the WDK for Windows Vista. With no intervening IFS Kit for reference, I infer 
  that the version 6.0 documentation requires Windows XP for these ancient functions 
  because it was for Windows XP that Microsoft first documented them. Note that 
  no such generosity of inference is as easily supported for the three (<span class="delayed function">CcCopyRead</span>,
  <span class="delayed function">CcCopyWrite</span> and
  <span class="delayed function">CcZeroData</span>) that Microsoft later says require 
  Windows 2000. </p>

  example of Microsoft’s having retracted a misrepresentation that a function requires 
  Windows 2000 when in fact its availability is ancient. Perhaps someone with a 
  level head (and the right clout) pointed out the absurdity that the one exported 
  function that the kernel provided from the start for the vital matter of breaking 
  to a debugger had been documented all along but suddenly “can only be used in 
  Windows 2000 and later.” </p>

  <p>The nine functions that work with the Executive’s synchronisation resource 
  have a complicated history. The implementation was significantly redeveloped for 
  the very next version but its reduction of the <span class="struct">
  <a href="../api/ex/resource/eresource.htm">ERESOURCE</a></span> structure meant 
  that new drivers, allowing only for a smaller size, could not safely use the old 
  functions when running with an old kernel. For new drivers, version 3.50 exports 
  a new set of functions. These are mostly named from the old just by appending 
  Lite. For old drivers, the old functions live on in two ways. First, all the old 
  functions are redefined by macro in terms of the new so that an old driver rebuilt 
  with a new DDK (presumably as early as the one for version 3.50) is in effect 
  a new driver without having needed any rewriting of source code. Second, so that 
  old drivers that are not rebuilt might run on the next few Windows versions, four 
  of the original five functions that had been documented continue to be exported 
  up to and including version 5.0. The other that had been documented had already 
  been redefined by macro such that old drivers should not be importing it. This 
  function and the four that had never been documented cease as exports right from 
  version 3.50. The five that had been documented stayed documented but as the first 
  kernel functions to be documented as obsolete. The four that had never been documented 
  and were now discontinued might have been left to oblivion, but the Windows 2000 
  DDK revived them just to document them as obsolete (even though they cannot be 
  imported). </p>
  <p>The <span class="function">ExQueueWorkItem</span> function is unusual for having 
  been obsolete and then not, and also for having been documented differently concurrently. 
  In the WDK for Windows Vista, the function has one page of documentation for programming 
  that uses just the DDK and another for the more specialised use that is catered 
  to by the IFS Kit. The DDK page has the function as obsolete. This dates from 
  the DDK for Windows 2000, which introduced <span class="function">IoQueueWorkItem</span> 
  for drivers to use instead. For versions 5.1 and 5.2 the function stayed obsolete 
  in the DDK, but perhaps it got different documentation in the IFS Kit for either 
  or both of these versions. The IFS page for Windows Vista looks to have revived 
  the function’s documentation from before Windows 2000, with warnings added about 
  needing “extreme caution”. Though the WDK for Windows Vista has both the DDK and 
  IFS documentation, later WDKs retain only the latter and thus do not present the 
  function as obsolete—as far as spelled out in the documentation. In the headers, 
  however, the status is a little different. Starting with the WDK for Windows 7, 
  an annotation for Microsoft’s tools for static code analysis states clearly that 
  the function is “Obsolete in all drivers for Vista. Obsolete downlevel except 
  for limited use in IFS. See the documentation”, but the cited documentation does 
  not itself say the function is obsolete. </p>
  <p>The <span class="delayed function">ExRaiseStatus</span> function may be documented 
  as early as version 3.50 but is here conjectured not to have been, it being thought 
  more natural to have got documented for version 3.51 while working on the latter 
  to introduce <span class="delayed function">ExRaiseAccessViolation</span> and
  <span class="delayed function">ExRaiseDatatypeMisalignment</span>. Against this, 
  of course, is that these two functions for version 3.51 weren’t also documented.
  </p>
  <p>The three functions whose names start with <span class="functionprefix">Exi386</span> 
  are notable for reversing the usual transition in which undocumented functions 
  get declared (and eventually documented). In version 3.10, they are the explicitly 
  declared exports for their interlocked operations but they are left undocumented 
  as a platform-specific implementation detail. The documented functions, which 
  are platform-independent and do not have i386 in their names, are exported but 
  NTDDK.H redefines them by macro when building for the x86. Version 3.50 has new 
  platform-specific variants with a different calling convention and the new prefix
  <span class="functionprefix">Exfi386</span> in their names. If there was a DDK 
  for Windows NT 3.50, it surely will have changed to declaring the
  <span class="functionprefix">Exfi386</span> functions, leaving the
  <span class="functionprefix">Exi386</span> functions to be lost from the declarations 
  and become undocumented. The documented platform-independent
  <span class="obsolete function">ExInterlockedDecrementLong</span>, etc., will 
  then have become obsolete when version 3.51 simplified to
  <span class="function">InterlockedDecrement</span>, etc. </p>

  <p>Of kernel exports for which the first known documentation is the IFS Kit for 
  Windows 2000, <span class="delayed function">FsRtlIsTotalDeviceFailure</span> 
  is alone in having been declared in earlier editions of the ordinary DDK—indeed, 
  right from the DDK for Windows NT 3.10. </p>
  <p>Though no public documentation of <span class="minwin function">FsRtlMdlRead</span> 
  is known, nor even a declaration except in NTOSP.H from those early editions of 
  the WDK for Windows 10, the function does get mentioned among the Remarks in documentation 
  of <span class="delayed function">FsRtlIncrementCcFastMdlReadWait</span>. This 
  starts for Windows 8, which happens also to be the version that introduces
  <span class="function">FsRtlMdlReadEx</span>. </p>

  <p>As with most exported variables, <span class="declared variable">IoFileObjectType</span> 
  is not itself documented. Starting with the DDK for Windows 2000, however, it 
  gets mentioned in the documentation of exported functions such as
  <span class="function">ObReferenceObjectByHandle</span> from its being intended 
  as an argument. </p>
  <p>Though <span class="undocumented function">IoReportHalResourceUsage</span> 
  is not known ever to have been documented or declared, it features in a comment 
  in NTDDK.H starting with the DDK for Windows 2000. Some measure of what undocumented 
  can mean is that the (single-line) comment is for a member of an undocumented 
  enumeration that NTDDK.H shows only as a member of an undocumented structure that 
  is presented only as being accessed from four more undocumented structures that 
  are in turn only in an undocumented union whose address can be passed among the 
  arguments of an undocumented function type, a pointer to which can be a member 
  of an undocumented structure that neither NTDDK.H nor any other WDK header refers 
  to. </p>
  <p>In version 3.10, <span class="declared variable">IoStatisticsLock</span> is 
  the spin lock that protects the 64-bit counters such as
  <span class="declared variable">IoReadTransferCount</span> that eventually get 
  declared together in NTIFS.H. What makes it notable for a historical survey is 
  that it got declared only after the kernel had stopped using it—indeed, long after, 
  since this last known use did not survive even to version 3.50. </p>

  <p>In all versions of x86 Windows that have both
  <span class="undocumented function">KeGetPreviousMode</span> and
  <span class="function">ExGetPreviousMode</span>, the two have the same address. 
  The x64 kernel exports only the latter and the former seems never to have been 
  documented for any architecture. Among the headers from the driver kits that are 
  available for inspection, <span class="undocumented function">KeGetPreviousMode</span> 
  appears only once: the NTDDK.H in the DDK for Windows XP has it (conditionally) 
  as a macro that can’t compile without whatever private header defines the
  <span class="member">PreviousMode</span> member of the ordinarily opaque
  <span class="struct"><a href="../inc/ntos/ke/kthread/index.htm">KTHREAD</a></span>.
  </p>
  <p>Not only are <span class="minwin">KeInitializeApc</span> and
  <span class="minwin">KeInsertQueueApc</span> among the oldest of kernel exports 
  that Microsoft left without public declarations until the presumably accidental 
  disclosure of NTOSP.H in 2015, but there must be a good case that they’re the 
  most signficant. Contrast with <span class="function">KeInitializeDpc</span> and 
  <span class="function">KeInsertQueueDpc</span>, which have been documented from 
  the very beginning. Microsoft needs that drivers for hardware devices can schedule 
  a Deferred Procedure Call (DPC), but scheduling an Asynchronous Procedure Call 
  (APC) from kernel mode has always been functionality that Microsoft keeps to itself, 
  at first for the kernel’s internal use but eventually also for file system drivers 
  if written by Microsoft. </p>
  <p>Though practical use of <span class="obsolete variable">KeNumberProcessors</span> 
  was demonstrated by Microsoft in source code samples published as far back as 
  the DDK for Windows 2000, this variable’s first documentation is only in passing, 
  where the WDK for Windows Vista warns that “Device drivers that are built for 
  Windows Vista and later” should use the new <span class="function">KeQueryActiveProcessorCount</span> 
  function instead. The variable first gets its own page in the WDK for Windows 
  7, but only then to say formally that it’s obsolete (starting from Windows Vista 
  SP1). </p>
  <p>The kernel started with the mutant and mutex as separate types of synchronisation 
  object. Their unification for version 3.50 was problematic because the mutex, 
  which had been documented, was in effect redefined to be the same as the mutant, 
  which had not been documented. For the <span class="function">KeReadStateMutex</span> 
  function, the redefinition is literal: headers in the next few versions of the 
  DDK redefine <span class="function">KeReadStateMutex</span> by macro as
  <span class="reserved function">KeReadStateMutant</span>. The problem is that 
  the latter is not declared. For all practical effect, at least for programmers 
  outside Microsoft, <span class="function">KeReadStateMutex</span> was documented 
  but not declared. </p>
  <p>In version 3.10 only, <span class="delayed function">KeWaitForMutexObject</span> 
  and <span class="function">KeWaitForSingleObject</span> have separate implementations. 
  The former was specialised to waiting on a single object that is known to be a 
  mutex, but it was neither documented nor declared. The more general function was 
  also good for waiting on a mutex, though less good than the specialised function, 
  and was both documented and declared. Later kernels lose the mutex-specific implementation, 
  keeping both functions as exports but with the same address. The corresponding 
  DDK, starting at least for Windows NT 3.51, redefines the one function into the 
  other by macro and documents both. Up to and including the WDK for Windows 7, 
  this documentation of <span class="delayed function">KeWaitForMutexObject</span> 
  presents what looks to be the original declaration, with the function needing 
  the address of a mutex specifically. This declaration does not exist in the headers.

  <p>The kernel’s six Local Security Authority (LSA) functions are specially difficult 
  for a historical survey of documentation status. All six have long been documented 
  for user-mode programming—the earliest that I have found, from a Platform SDK 
  for January 2000, even says each function “Requires Windows NT 3.1 or later”—but 
  if Microsoft has ever documented any of them for use in kernel mode, then I don’t 
  know where. This might not matter. After all, the kernel’s exported implementations 
  of C Run-Time (CRT) functions are not explicitly documented for kernel-mode use, 
  yet nobody could sensibly count them as undocumented. The complication for the 
  LSA functions is that Microsoft hasn’t just left kernel-mode use as unstated. 
  Things have been done that differentiate the kernel-mode exports from the same-named 
  user-mode exports, and I think this must be taken as deliberate such that kernel-mode 
  use actually is meant not to be documented. </p>
  <p>Since neither the DDK nor SDK for Windows NT 3.1 has any mention of these functions 
  either in documentation or in any header for inclusion in source code, there surely 
  can be no dispute that all six are initially undocumented even in user mode. The 
  DDK for Windows NT 3.51 has NTSECAPI.H with declarations of all six. It and the 
  DDK for Windows NT 4.0 also have an LSAAUTH.HLP file that does not formally document 
  any of the functions but does mention four of them and even says that “services” 
  are “callable from both user mode and kernel mode.” </p>
  <p>That all six are declared in a header that shipped with the DDK does not obviously 
  mean that all were intended for kernel-mode use. Notably, NTSECAPI.H has the declarations 
  in a conditional-compilation block so that they are dropped if NTIFS.H is included 
  first. For version 3.51, NTIFS.H was still many years away from open distribution. 
  In its first version that’s more or less readily available, with the Windows 2000 
  IFS Kit, NTIFS.H declares just <span class="declared function">LsaRegisterLogonProcess</span> 
  and <span class="declared function">LsaFreeReturnBuffer</span> (and mentions
  <span class="undocumented function">LsaCallAuthenticationPackage</span> and
  <span class="declared function">LsaLogonUser</span> in comments). Some time after, 
  but certainly by the WDK for Windows Vista, <span class="declared function">LsaLogonUser</span> 
  gets declared too. Three of the functions, then, are unambiguously intended for 
  kernel-mode use, at least since the NTIFS.H from version 5.0, even if not documented 
  for it. </p>
  <p>The declarations in NTSECAPI.H remain to this day. They’re also in a new header 
  named NTLSA.H, starting with the WDK for Windows Vista. In the WDK for Windows 
  8, however, a reorganisation of headers into subdirectories named “km”, “um” and 
  “shared” surely is intended by Microsoft as showing which headers are for kernel-mode 
  programming, user-mode programming and both. Since NTSECAPI.H and NTLSA.H both 
  move to the “um” subdirectory, I think their declarations cannot be counted as 
  intended for kernel-mode use. </p>

  <p>Documentation of <span class="obsolete function">MmMapLockedPages</span> is 
  qualified: even now, in 2020, it is “obsolete for Windows 2000 and later”. When 
  this was first said of the function, the point will have been that continued use 
  was anticipated for drivers that find themselves running on an earlier Windows. 
  This would be unremarkable except that by late 2009 it becomes one of the few 
  examples of Microsoft acknowledging a kernel export as being available before 
  Windows 2000. It also presents the quirk that the opposite function,
  <span class="function">MmUnmapLockedPages</span>, is only “Available starting

  <h3><span class="functionprefix">Nt</span> Functions and Variable </h3>
  <!--webbot bot="Include" U-Include="_include/nt.htm" TAG="BODY" startspan -->

<p>The functions whose names begin with <span class="functionprefix">Nt</span> correspond 
closely to functions whose names have the <span class="functionprefix">Zw</span> 
prefix instead (see below). Except for some general points about how the two differ—see
<a href="../../../win32/ntdll/api/native.htm">The Native API</a>—documentation 
of an <span class="functionprefix">Nt</span> function is to a large extent implied 
by documentation of the corresponding <span class="functionprefix">Zw</span> function.
</p>
<p>Though this correspondence will have been understood well enough by all competent 
kernel-mode programmers, Microsoft didn’t make it explicit until some time after 
releasing the WDK for Windows Vista. This is here taken as an intention to leave 
the <span class="functionprefix">Nt</span> functions <span class="undocumented">
undocumented</span> (if not <span class="declared">declared</span>) before version 
6.1. </p>
<p>Documentation in the WDK for Windows 7 gives each
<span class="functionprefix">Nt</span> function its own page, but this merely directs 
attention to the page for the corresponding <span class="functionprefix">Zw</span> 
function. The <span class="functionprefix">Zw</span> documentation might then be 
treated as counting for both, except that the <span class="functionprefix">Nt</span> 
documentation warns expressly “Do not call this routine from kernel-mode code.” 
This is here taken as documenting the <span class="functionprefix">Nt</span> functions 
as <span class="reserved">reserved</span> in version 6.1 (certainly for kernel-mode 
use, which is this survey’s focus). </p>
<p>Microsoft loosened the text significantly for Windows 8 to note that the
<span class="functionprefix">Nt</span> and <span class="functionprefix">Zw</span> 
versions “can behave differently” and to refer to a page of guidance. These changes, 
though slight, are taken here as formally permitting the
<span class="functionprefix">Nt</span> functions’ kernel-mode use, such that they 
must now be counted as documented (though <span class="delayed">delayed</span>).
</p>
<p>While each <span class="functionprefix">Nt</span> function is documented only 
by reference to the <span class="functionprefix">Zw</span> function, whatever documented 
availability Microsoft gives for the latter is here taken as intended also for the 
former. In the headers, however, the two functions necessarily each have their own 
declaration (if they have any), and so any “declared start” shown below is specifically 
for the <span class="functionprefix">Nt</span> function. </p>

  <p>Though <span class="declared variable">NtGlobalFlag</span> is not formally 
  documented, nor quite counts as indirectly documented, it is well known to kernel-mode 
  programmers as the variable where the kernel keeps what Microsoft’s GFLAGS.EXE 
  tool calls Kernel Flags. Microsoft’s early description of this tool (as for the 
  Knowledge Base article Q206848, titled <span class="citation">Windows NT Service 
  Pack 4.0 Tools Not Included on CD-ROM</span> but long gone from Microsoft’s website) 
  was that it “edits the NtGlobalFlag settings for Windows in the registry.” Even 
  before this, some programmers will have known that I386KD has a command-line switch
  <span class="switch">-x</span> that tells this debugger to execute an
  <span class="command">eb</span> command to set this variable to 9. </p>
  <p>The <span class="undocumented function">NtNotifyChangeDirectoryFile</span> 
  function is mentioned in comments in NTIFS.H starting from the IFS Kit for Windows 
  2000 and in WDM.H starting from the WDK for Windows Vista, but has never yet been 
  declared. The story is only slightly different for
  <span class="undocumented function">NtQueryEaFile</span>: it too is mentioned 
  in a comment in NTIFS.H from the IFS Kit for Windows 2000, but the comment then 
  moves to WDM.H. </p>
  <p>More obscurely, <span class="undocumented function">NtRequestPort</span> and
  <span class="undocumented function">NtRequestWaitReplyPort</span> share a comment 
  in the NTIFS.H from the WDK for Windows Vista, which is never repeated in later 
  editions. The second of this pair is notable because this header also declares

  It is here speculated, though with some confidence, that these declarations started

  long gone now. </p>
  <p>The <span class="undocumented function">NtSetInformationProcess</span> function

  the DDK for Windows NT 3.51, yet it too never has been declared. </p>

  <p>Though the kernel does not export <span class="delayed function">ProbeForRead</span> 
  in versions 3.50 to 4.0, the function can be identified in these versions as an 
  internal routine—not just in the kernel but in Microsoft’s drivers that had imported 
  it from the kernel in version 3.10. It seems to have been considered simple enough 
  for definition as an inline routine (or even as a macro) in headers that Microsoft 
  kept for its own programming. Perhaps only in version 5.0 did Microsoft care (or 
  realise) that non-Microsoft programmers would better have easy access to a standard 
  way to test the plausibility of inputs received from user mode. The early history 
  of this function, which exists only for security, may thus be useful as a data 
  point in assessing modern perceptions of security’s early neglect. </p>

  <p>For the second edition of the WDK for Windows 7, numbered 7600.16385.1, the 
  most extensive revision was that almost all of the kernel’s original exports became 
  documented as being “Available in Windows 2000 and later versions of Windows.” 
  From some perspective, stating this among the Requirements is even generous: the 
  WDK for Windows 7 explicitly does not support development of drivers for execution 
  on anything older than Windows XP, so why mention Windows 2000 at all? Still, 
  the aim surely was to dismiss earlier versions as if they had never existed. For 
  some measure of Microsoft’s determination in this tidying of history by wiping 
  it out, consider <span class="delayed variable">PsInitialSystemProcess</span>. 
  When this original export was newly documented with its own page in the first 
  edition, numbered 7600.16385.0, of the WDK for Windows 7, Microsoft took the liberty 
  of starting the export’s availability at Microsoft Windows NT 4.0. This was not 
  allowed to stand even for six months before needing “correction” to Windows 2000. 
  Call me cynical, but Microsoft is rarely so swift even for true corrections.

  <p>Though <span class="declared variable">PsProcessType</span> and
  <span class="declared variable">PsThreadType</span> are not themselves documented, 
  they get mentioned in the documentation of exported functions such as
  <span class="function">ObReferenceObjectByHandle</span> from being intended as 
  an argument. This starts with the WDK for Windows Vista. </p>

  <p>The <span class="functionprefix">READ_REGISTER</span> functions have x64 support 
  as inlined routines defined in WDM.H. Exported or not, they abstract the reading 
  of I/O registers in memory space. The HAL exports counterparts that do the same 
  but from I/O space. All have been documented from the start under some such heading 
  as Hardware Abstraction Layer Routines which may be just separate enough that 
  they were missed when a revision of the WDK for Windows 7 spuriously dated almost 
  all the ancient documented functions to Windows 2000. If this was an oversight, 
  it was soon put right, so to speak. </p>

  <p>Some <span class="functionprefix">Rtl</span> functions are supposed above to 
  have been documented first in an IFS Kit for Windows XP or for Windows Server 
  2003 SP1 even though neither kit has been obtained for inspection. In each such 
  case, the function’s documentation in the WDK for Windows Vista is in the IFS 
  section and already gives the earlier version as the minimum. The inference is 
  that although the minimum is entirely fictitious for when the function is first 
  exported from the kernel, it is credibly correct about when the function was first 
  documented for use by non-Microsoft programmers. Beware of a further inference: 
  conditional-compilation blocks that the WDK for Windows Vista adds to the declarations 
  are here dismissed as having been written independently of the documentation, 
  else <span class="delayed function">RtlCreateHeap</span> and
  <span class="delayed function">RtlDestroyHeap</span> were documented as early 
  as the Windows XP IFS Kit while <span class="delayed function">RtlAllocateHeap</span> 
  and <span class="delayed function">RtlFreeHeap</span> were not. </p>
  <p>Though <span class="delayed function">RtlEqualLuid</span> is exported from 
  all known versions of the Windows kernel, no known edition of NTDDK.H and WDM.H 
  declares it as a function: all define it by macro. </p>
  <p>That <span class="undocumented function">RtlFindFirstRunSet</span> and
  <span class="undocumented function">RtlFindLongestRunSet</span> cease as exported 
  functions in version 5.0 may have been a late decision: both are declared in the 
  NTIFS.H from the Windows 2000 IFS Kit. </p>
  <p>The <span class="delayed function">RtlFreeHeap</span> function is another rarity 
  for having changed its prototype while documented. Its return type widens from
  <span class="type">BOOLEAN</span> to <span class="type">LOGICAL</span> in version 
  6.2. There are in practice no implications for compatibility in kernel mode (even 
  allowing that any programmers ever do check this function for failure). The change 
  was documented immediately. Conditional compilation ensures that new drivers that 
  are built to run on an old Windows are for this purpose old drivers: they expect 
  the smaller return type and are not troubled if run on a new Windows. The change 
  appears instead to have been motivated by user-mode considerations, there having 
  been a long-running off-and-on problem with matching the NTDLL implementation 
  of <span class="function">RtlFreeHeap</span> (returning an 8-bit
  <span class="type">BOOLEAN</span>) to the Win32 <span class="function">HeapFree</span> 
  function (returning a 32-bit <span class="type">BOOL</span>). </p>
  <p>Another change of prototype affects <span class="delayed function">RtlGenerate8dot3Name</span>. 
  Starting with version 6.0 SP1, it returns an <span class="type">NTSTATUS</span> 
  instead of returning nothing. Again, conditional compilation ensures that the 
  new return type is known only to new drivers that are built to run only on new 
  Windows. This change, however, was not documented immediately. Not until the WDK 
  for Windows 8 does the documentation even show the new return type under the Syntax 
  heading, but nothing in the Remarks alerts the reader to any change of functionality 
  and the textual description of the “Return value” persists as “None”. This didn’t 
  get addressed until some time after the first WDK for Windows 10. </p>

  <p>The documentation history of <span class="delayed function">ZwDeleteValueKey</span> 
  is complicated by documentation in parallel. No documentation or declaration is 
  known from any DDK before Windows XP. In the WDK for Windows Vista, however, it 
  has two pages: one under Installable File System; the other in the general section 
  for Driver Support Routines. Presumably, it had been documented in an IFS Kit 
  before the merger into the WDK for Windows Vista. The IFS documentation starts 
  the function’s availability at Windows XP. Without a Windows XP IFS Kit for reference, 
  it can’t be discounted as the first documentation. The less developed documentation 
  in the general section appears first in the DDK for Windows Server 2003 SP1 and 
  says nothing about availability. The WDK for Windows 7 drops it in favour of the 
  IFS documentation, but with the function’s availability changed to Windows 2000 
  and later. </p>

  <p>References to the <span class="undocumented function">_except_handler2</span> 
  function are generated by sufficiently early versions of Microsoft’s compilers 
  for the prologue code of C and C++ functions that use Structured Exception Handling 
  (SEH). The function is not known ever to have been documented, not just as an 
  export from the kernel but even as an implementation detail of Microsoft’s compilers. 
  That said, it is named on a page of <span class="citation">Internal CRT Globals 
  and Functions</span>, which looks to have been prepared for Visual Studio 2015.
  </p>
  <p>The <span class="delayed reserved function">_local_unwind2</span> function 
  is similarly old as a compiler-generated name but has survived longer. Calls to 
  it are generated by Microsoft’s compilers when C and C++ functions leave a
  <span class="keyword">__finally</span> block non-trivially. As the earliest documentation 
  that I have yet found, the function got a page to itself in the
  <span class="citation">Alphabetical Function Reference</span> within the
  <span class="citation">C Run-Time Library Reference</span> for Visual Studio 2012. 
  Then and still (but now among the <span class="citation">Internal CRT Globals 
  and Functions</span>), programmers are warned “Do not call the method in your
