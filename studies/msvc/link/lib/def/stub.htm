<h1>STUB </h1>
<p>The <span class="def">STUB </span>statement is supported only when building 
an export file for a VxD. It is otherwise ignored after a warning (LNK4017). </p>
<h2>Syntax </h2>
<p><span class="def">STUB</span> is a single-line statement. It is a fatal error 
(LNK1118) if the statement is empty. The <span class="def">STUB</span> tag must 
be followed by at least one space or tab. There may then be any amount of white 
space, including none, before the definition. The ordinary syntax is: </p>
<blockquote>
  <p><span class="def">STUB </span><span class="placeholder">pathname</span><span class="def">
  </span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>such that <span class="placeholder">filename</span> is all the text on the 
remainder of the line (including trailing white space). A variation is: </p>
<blockquote>
  <p><span class="def">STUB &#39;</span><span class="placeholder">pathname</span><span class="def">&#39;
  </span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here, the first character of the argument is a single-quote, and
<span class="placeholder">pathname</span> begins with the next character and 
continues up to but not including the last single-quote on the remainder of the 
line. It is a fatal error (LNK1118) if there is not another single-quote on the 
line. Characters beyond the last single-quote are irrelevant and are ignored 
without complaint.
</p>
<h2>Command-Line Translation </h2>
<p>The <span class="def">STUB</span> statement translates to a
<span class="switch">/stub</span> option for the export-file command line. The 
form is: </p>
<blockquote>
  <p><span class="switch">/STUB:&quot;</span><span class="placeholder">pathname</span><span class="switch">&quot;
  </span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>where <span class="placeholder">pathname</span> is from the definition, as 
described above. </p>
<h3>Buffer Overrun </h3>
<p>The code for generating the <span class="switch">/stub</span> switch uses a 
128-byte buffer on the stack but does not check the lengths of the strings it 
copies there. A sufficiently long <span class="placeholder">pathname</span> can 
therefore induce an overrun and corrupt the stack, including to overwrite the 
relevant procedure’s return address. In the version studied for these notes, 
namely 7.00.9466, the procedure has been compiled with the Buffer Security Check 
enabled and the placement of the buffer is such that even a one-byte overrun is 
caught. </p>
<p>For a demonstration, prepare a module definition file, here named TEST.DEF, 
containing just the following as one (long) line: </p>
<pre class="source">STUB 123456789\123456789\...1234567890</pre>
<p>where the ellipsis stands for as many repetitions of 123456789\ as needed for 
the <span class="placeholder">text</span> argument to count to 120. With 8 bytes 
for the characters of the <span class="switch">/stub</span> switch, its colon 
and two double-quotes, the null byte at the end of the string will be one byte 
too many. Running </p>
<pre class="input">lib /def:test.def /machine:x86 /vxd</pre>
<p>triggers the buffer overrun. Repeat with <span class="placeholder">pathname</span> 
reduced by one byte, and there is no buffer overrun. </p>
<h3>White Space and Quotes </h3>
<p>Note that a <span class="placeholder">pathname</span> with white space need 
not be enclosed in quotes of either sort when given in the <span class="def">
STUB</span> 
statement. All the white space gets enclosed in double-quotes when carried to 
the
<span class="switch">/stub</span> option. This is true even of trailing white 
space, such as occurs if the <span class="placeholder">pathname</span> without 
single-quotes is followed by white space and then by a comment. (Remember that 
by this stage of parsing, LIB treats a comment as having ended the line.) </p>
<p>Enclosure between single-quotes in the <span class="def">STUB</span> 
statement is supported explicitly and has the merit of marking clearly which 
characters are intended as the <span class="placeholder">pathname</span> for the
<span class="switch">/stub</span> option. </p>
<p>Double-quotes in the <span class="placeholder">pathname</span> are 
problematic. They carry into the <span class="placeholder">pathname</span> for 
the
<span class="switch">/stub</span> option in the export file, but the enclosure 
in double-quotes for the option inverts the pairing of the double-quotes in the 
definition.
