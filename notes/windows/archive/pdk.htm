  <h1>Windows 95 DDK does not install after Platform SDK </h1>
  <p>The Windows 95 Device Driver Kit (DDK) is supplied on CD-ROM with most files 
  already in the expected directory tree. Although these files may simply be copied 
  to the hard disk, a setup program eases the installation and also prepares a batch 
  file for setting environment variables. </p>
  <p>For reasons that may be less than obvious to VxD programmers, the Windows 95 
  DDK requires prior installation of the Win32 SDK. Since the release of the Windows 
  95 DDK, much of the Win32 SDK has been incorporated into the Platform SDK. The 
  Win32 SDK and Platform SDK continued to be distributed as separate kits, but for 
  most practical purposes in 32-bit applications programming (which is surely what 
  the Win32 SDK would be installed for), the Win32 SDK has been superseded by the 
  Platform SDK. </p>
  <h2>Problem </h2>
  <p>If the Platform SDK has been installed instead of the Win32 SDK, a subsequent 
  attempt to run the setup program for the Windows 95 DDK meets with the complaint 
  that “You need to install the SDK first; Please exit this setup program, and run 
  the Win32 SDK Setup program.” </p>
  <h3>Applicable Versions </h3>
  <p>This note applies to versions of the Windows 95 DDK at least as far back as 
  July 1996, and to versions as recent as July 1998. It applies to versions of the 
  Platform SDK at least as far back as November 1996. </p>
  <p>The problem described here is not presented by versions of the Platform SDK 
  dated from January 1998 onwards. </p>
  <h2>Cause </h2>
  <p>Three registry entries are relevant, and it is as well to introduce them before 
  proceeding. The two for the SDKs use the same value in different keys: </p>
  <table class="Registry">
    <tr>
      <td>Key </td>
      <td><span class="regkey">HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Win32SDK\Directories</span>
      <br>
      <span class="regkey">HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\PlatformSDK\Directories</span>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Value </td>
      <td><span class="regvalue">Install Dir</span> </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Type </td>
      <td><span class="constant">REG_SZ</span> </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  <p>Take care to note that the value contains a space but the product names in 
  the keys do not. In the third of the relevant entries, by contrast, the product 
  name has spaces but the value does not: </p>
  <table class="Registry">
    <tr>
      <td>Key </td>
      <td><span class="regkey">HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows 95 PDK\Directories</span>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Value </td>
      <td><span class="regvalue">InstallDir</span> </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Type </td>
      <td><span class="constant">REG_SZ</span> </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  <p>The setup program for the Win32 SDK prepares the <span class="regkey">Win32SDK</span> 
  key and sets the <span class="regvalue">Install Dir</span> value to the root of 
  the SDK directory tree. The setup program for the Platform SDK does the same, 
  but with the <span class="regkey">PlatformSDK</span> key. </p>
  <p>The Platform SDK does know the registry entry from the Win32 SDK, but only 
  to change from one to the other. See that in MSSDK.INF from the Platform SDK, 
  the line </p>
  <pre class="source">set KeySDKPath = &quot;Software\Microsoft\Win32SDK\Directories&quot; </pre>
  <p>as inherited from WIN32.INF in the Win32 SDK, is commented out and </p>
  <pre class="source">set KeySDKPath = &quot;Software\Microsoft\PlatformSDK\Directories&quot; </pre>
  <p>is added. </p>
  <p>The reason that the Windows 95 DDK requires the Win32 SDK specifically is simply 
  that where the setup program for the Windows 95 DDK tests for prior installation 
  of an SDK, it recognises entries under <span class="regkey">Win32SDK</span> and
  <span class="regkey">Windows 95 PDK</span>, but knows nothing of the entry under
  <span class="regkey">PlatformSDK</span>. </p>
  <h2>Work-Around </h2>
  <p>Edit the registry to pretend, if only temporarily, that one of the expected 
  SDKs is already installed. Create the key and value, as above, under
  <span class="regkey">Win32SDK</span> (or <span class="regkey">Windows 95 PDK</span>), 
  giving the path of the Platform SDK’s root directory as the string data, as if 
  the Win32 SDK (or the Windows 95 PDK) had been installed before the Platform SDK 
  in the same directory. </p>
  <p>For Microsoft’s different view of the problem, see the Knowledge Base article 
  Q169581, titled <span class="citation">PRB: Windows 95 DDK Won’t Install After 
  Installing Platform SDK</span>. The resolution proposed there is surely a joke:
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>The Windows 95 DDK requires prior installation of the Win32 SDK; the Platform 
    SDK will not suffice. The Win32 SDK is provided on a separate CD-ROM from the 
    Platform SDK. </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>For the purposes of VxD programming, it’s far from clear why the Win32 SDK 
  is required for anything. The asserted dependence is highly artificial, so that 
  the refusal of the DDK’s setup program to continue without the Win32 SDK in particular 
  is especially annoying when a programmer already has the Platform SDK installed.
  </p>
  <h2>Fix </h2>
  <p>The Platform SDK dated January 1998 has a new installation method in which 
  files are extracted from cabinets. Preparation of the registry entries relevant 
  to the present problem is governed by CORECFG.INF, from which it may be seen that 
  this new Platform SDK sets <span class="regvalue">Install Dir</span> in both the
  <span class="regkey">Win32SDK</span> and <span class="regkey">PlatformSDK</span> 
  keys (and in both <span class="regkey">HKEY_CURRENT_USER</span> and
  <span class="regkey">HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE</span>). Thus, with the new Platform SDK 
  installed, the setup program for the Windows 95 DDK will be satisfied that the 
  Win32 SDK is installed, just as in the work-around presented above. </p>
  <p>In a revised Knowledge Base article, still available as
  <a target="_top" href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/249286">BUG: Cannot Install 
  Windows 95 DDK After Installing Platform SDK</a>, Microsoft explains that “Microsoft 
  Windows Platform SDK doesn’t create the registry keys that are required by the 
  Windows 95 DDK Setup program” and recommends the work-around as an alternative 
  to installing the latest Platform SDK. </p>
