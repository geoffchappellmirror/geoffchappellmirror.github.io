  <h1>InfoMask in the Object Header </h1>
  <p>Though an <span class="struct"><a href="index.htm">OBJECT_HEADER</a></span> 
  immediately precedes every object, it too has structures ahead of it. The
  <span class="struct">OBJECT_HEADER</span> has what’s needed more or less immediately 
  for almost every operation on almost every object, including to point the way 
  to these other structures that are useful only for some operations and some objects.
  </p>
  <p>Originally, the <span class="struct">OBJECT_HEADER</span> is preceded only 
  by an <span class="struct">OBJECT_CREATE_INFORMATION</span>, but this structure 
  is relatively large and wastes on two counts. First, not all of it needs to be 
  kept for the whole of any object’s life, at least not in the form given. Second, 
  not all of it is even given for every object. Version 3.50 substantially reduced 
  the overhead by being selective about what’s retained. The
  <span class="struct">OBJECT_CREATE_INFORMATION</span> is in a separate memory 
  allocation, to be freed eventually, and many of its original members are instead 
  in four other structures that can be present as header’s headers. The
  <span class="struct">OBJECT_HEADER</span> then has four single-byte members which 
  are each the negative offset to the corresponding header, else are zero. One byte 
  for each of these is also wasteful. The header’s headers all have known sizes 
  and though not all need be present, whichever are present have a known order. 
  The offsets to each from any one <span class="struct">OBJECT_HEADER</span> can 
  therefore be computed just from knowing which headers are present. This requires 
  just one bit per header. Thus was born the <span class="member">InfoMask</span> 
  in the <span class="struct">OBJECT_HEADER</span> for Windows 7 and higher: </p>

  <p>A set bit signifies that the corresponding header is present. Exactly where 
  the corresponding header is present before the <span class="struct">OBJECT_HEADER</span> 
  depends on which lower bits are set. This is because the increasing numerical 
  values of the bits is also the order of the corresponding headers backwards from 
  the <span class="struct">OBJECT_HEADER</span>. </p>
  <p>Microsoft’s names for the <span class="member">InfoMask</span> bits are not 
  known—not even from the NTOSP.H in early editions of the Windows Driver Kit (WDK) 
  for Windows 10, which otherwise helps with disclosures of macro definitions for 
  the <span class="member">TraceFlags</span> and <span class="member">Flags</span>. 
  Macro definitions surely do exist, but they will not be needed outside a handful 
  of source files that are private to the Object Manager. The details of locating 
  any of the headers from an <span class="struct">OBJECT_HEADER</span> would be 
  easily contained in internal routines, and public symbol files for the kernel 
  confirm that the following exist as inlined routines in the applicable versions 
  as long ago as Windows 8: </p>
  <pre class="source">OBJECT_HEADER_QUOTA_INFO *
OBJECT_HEADER_TO_QUOTA_INFO_EXISTS (
    OBJECT_HEADER *);</pre>
  <pre class="source">OBJECT_HEADER_PROCESS_INFO *
OBJECT_HEADER_TO_PROCESS_INFO_EXISTS (
    OBJECT_HEADER *);</pre>
  <pre class="source">OBJECT_HEADER_HANDLE_INFO *
OBJECT_HEADER_TO_HANDLE_INFO_EXISTS (
    OBJECT_HEADER *);</pre>
  <pre class="source">OBJECT_HEADER_NAME_INFO *
OBJECT_HEADER_TO_NAME_INFO_EXISTS (
    OBJECT_HEADER *);</pre>
  <pre class="source">OBJECT_HEADER_AUDIT_INFO *
OBJECT_HEADER_TO_AUDIT_INFO_EXISTS (
    OBJECT_HEADER *);</pre>
  <pre class="source">OBJECT_HEADER_HANDLE_REVOCATION_INFO *
OBJECT_HEADER_TO_HANDLE_REVOCATION_INFO_EXISTS (
    OBJECT_HEADER *);</pre>
  <p>Indeed, starting with the 1511 release, these routines, without the EXISTS 
  suffix, are in plain sight, being not inlined. </p>
