  <h1>New and Revised in May 2022 </h1>
  <p>For <a href="01.htm">January</a>, I noted that I must face “that my recent 
  diversions into retro-computing are no longer just diversions.” Add a few months 
  and it turns out that this is just one of many things that must be faced. By now 
  I start to realise that this is not new just for this year. It wasn’t new even 
  for late last year, when I as the long-ago author of a book titled
  <span class="citation">DOS Internals</span> looked again at DOS for the first 
  time in decades. </p>
  <p>Coincidentally with the pandemic but more and more evidently because of life 
  events that are specifically mine, I’ve let the last two years turn heavy with 
  retrospection. Even the few months of early 2021 that I spent on reworking the 
  website’s styles and scripts, even what in mid-2021 I thought at first was a development 
  of new themes—notably the question of what can reverse engineers learn of the 
  Windows source code solely from Microsoft’s readily published information—now 
  looks more like the start of a long tidying of whatever must pass for my somewhat 
  unorthodox career in computer programming. It may even be the beginning of the 
  end of this website’s new work. </p>
  <h2>Home </h2>
  <p>It’s not my usual practice to list additions and changes to the site’s introductory 
  pages as new or revised, and certainly not just the occasional summaries of what 
  got read. But except for the last few days of this month, my tidying of these 
  pages, which is still on-going, was all I could report. </p>

  <h2>Win32 </h2>
  <p>That said, the massed collection of statistics and especially the collation 
  for the whole year had the constructive effect of reminding me that some of the 
  site’s most-read pages are its lists of user-mode functions. I truly wish they 
  weren’t. I like to think I’ve made a far bigger contribution to my subject than 
  to have prepared these lists—and perhaps precisely because of this, I have neglected 
  them for much too long, even after writing as long ago as
  <a href="../../hot/21/04.htm">April 2021</a> that I would make a point of updating 
  them. </p>
  <p>For better or worse, my progress through these will be from low-level to high 
  and early to late. When I last worked on these pages, Windows 10 was more or less 
  new and the earliest Windows I had for inspection (from MSDN subscriptions in 
  the 1990s) was version 3.51. My collection has since got filled out.
  <span class="highlight">Only after I attend to the earliest versions to be sure 
  the history is well grounded will I update beyond the original Windows 10.</span> 
  My presently planned order is NTDLL, KERNEL32, KERNELBASE and ADVAPI32, but how 
  far I’ll persist with this is anyone’s guess. </p>
  <p>Please remember that although I do publish these lists and they are in some 
  sense the most detailed on the Internet for the versions they cover, they are 
  just my own notes to support my own work, whether of programming or reverse engineering 
  or even just for the bee I have in my bonnet about accurately recording the history 
  of Windows. If I happen not to do much user-mode work or none that requires the 
  use of very recent functionality, then I have no need of my own to update these 
  notes. </p>
  <p>If you want a reliable programme of updating, then please ask yourself (and 
  anyone who’ll listen) what is it that’s so disfunctional about our academy and 
  industry that you’re left with my lists as anything that may be worth looking 
  at. What has gone wrong that these lists aren’t prepared by research students 
  at some university or even by interns or salaried employees at a public-spirited 
  (or publicity-seeking) company for the benefit of all programmers and security 
  researchers? I’m biased, or jaded, but I don’t think the service is missed just 
  because we all think we have better things to do. </p>

  <h2>Kernel-Mode Windows </h2>
  <p>Because NTDLL is in large part the kernel’s footprint in user mode, the NTDLL 
  lists never could be written independently of the kernel’s lists. Presumably from 
  never having quite enough time, I never did get them well synchronised. Now, even 
  to extend the NTDLL lists to the earliest versions, it’s only inevitable that 
  I at least look at—and revise—what I had done a few years back on the same point 
  but for the kernel. Some revision was anyway required from having more recently 
  filled a few gaps in my collection of early versions’ service packs—and, as I 
  keep saying, kernel-mode always trumps user-mode for my interest. </p>

  <p>I can’t resist blowing my own horn on this, but as I review the kernel’s API 
  summary and start reworking NTDLL’s, I find I’m more than a little pleased with 
  myself for what now looks like an easy outcome of the months I put into web programming 
  back in <a href="../21/02.htm">February 2021</a>. Of course, this also means 
  I have revised the scripts a little. I don’t even try for compatibility with scripts 
  that persist in caches: if you get any errors or suspect any misbehaviour, please 
  refresh to get the latest scripts. </p>
