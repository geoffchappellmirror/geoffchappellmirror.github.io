<h1>Demonstration of Bug in DPA_Merge </h1>
<p>The <span class="function"><a href="merge.htm">DPA_Merge</a></span> function 
dates from 1997 and seems not to have been documented by Microsoft until 2005 or 
2006. For all its life so far, i.e., up to and including version 6.10 for Windows 
Vista SP1, the <span class="constant">DPAM_INTERSECT</span> case of the
<span class="function">DPA_Merge</span> function is unsafe to use due to a coding 
error. Microsoft seems never actually to use this case, else the bug might have 
been fixed long ago. Note in particular that the <span class="constant">DPAM_UNION</span> 
case, which has long seen real-world use by Microsoft, both within the shell and 
from Internet Explorer, started with a very similar bug which was corrected for 
version 5.80. </p>
<p>This history perhaps shows as well as any that defects in software can be spotted 
by independent review of <span class="emphasis">binary</span> code even in preference 
to a review of source code. Of course, programmers at Microsoft may face all sorts 
of pressure to identify just the coding error at the root of some reported problem 
and are perhaps not permitted the luxury of understanding the whole of the code 
for what it actually does. Still, it is striking that one bug in the function got 
fixed without realising (or attending to) its logical partner. A reader of binary 
code is more naturally directed to deciphering the whole logic of the whole code 
and may even benefit from not being exposed to comments (which may offer false assurances 
about the soundness of an algorithm). </p>
<p>A summary may help for understanding the bug. The <span class="function">DPA_Merge</span> 
function works with two Dynamic Pointer Arrays. A comparison function defines an 
ordering, both within a DPA and between the two DPAs. The first DPA is a target. 
The second is a source. In the <span class="constant">DPAM_INTERSECT</span> case, 
the function is to modify the target so that each item in the output target corresponds 
to a matched pair in the input source and input target, thus making the output target 
a sort of intersection of the input source and input target. The bug is that items 
remain in the target if they are lower than all source items. </p>
<p>To demonstrate the bug, I have a console application work with simple arrays 
and with comparison and merge functions that are nearly trivial. Each pointer in 
each array points to nothing more sophisticated than an unsigned integer. Pointers 
are compared just by the numerical value of the integers that they point to. Where 
the merge function is presented with matching pointers, it chooses the pointer that 
is already in the target DPA. In effect, the <span class="function">DPA_Merge</span> 
function is made to work with sets of numbers. For example, the commands </p>
<pre class="input">dpamerge /i {1,2,3,4} {2,3,5}</pre>
<pre class="input">dpamerge /u {1,2,3,4} {2,3,5}</pre>
<p>should calculate respectively the intersection and union of the two sets {1,2,3,4} 
and {2,3,5}. The expected results, as known even to primary school students, are 
{2,3} and {1,2,3,4,5}, but all known versions of <span class="function">DPA_Merge</span> 
compute the intersection as {1,2,3} because the target item 1 is lower than all 
the source items 2, 3 and 5. </p>
<p>For distribution, the built program (x86) is supplied with source code, compressed 
into one zip file: <a href="_download/dpamerge.zip">download the DPAMERGE bug demonstration</a>. 
Run from a Command Prompt (though of course I advise that you check for yourself 
that the program is what it says and that you rebuild it if you want). To learn 
of additional command-line switches for closer inspection of the function’s behaviour, 
run with the <span class="switch">/?</span> switch. </p>
