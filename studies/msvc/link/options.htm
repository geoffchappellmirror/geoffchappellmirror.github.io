<h1>LINK.EXE Options </h1>
<p>Each option begins with a <span class="definition">switch</span> whose first 
character is a forward slash or hyphen. The standard practice in these notes is 
to use the forward slash in all references to LINK.EXE options, leaving it as 
understood that the hyphen is equivalent unless otherwise stated. </p>
<p>A question mark is permitted between the forward slash or hyphen and the 
ordinary characters of the switch. Only very rarely is this any more than a 
curiosity. All references to LINK.EXE options should be understood as applying 
equally to the form with a question mark inserted, unless otherwise stated. </p>
<h2>Arguments </h2>
<p>The switch may be followed by a colon to introduce either a single
<span class="definition">argument</span> or a list of arguments separated by 
commas. Each argument in the list may decompose into a <span class="definition">
property</span> 
and a <span class="definition">value</span>, separated by an equals sign. </p>
<p>Thus, there is a first syntax </p>
<blockquote>
  <p><span class="placeholder">switch</span>[<span class="switch">:</span><span class="placeholder">argument</span>]<span class="switch">
  </span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>in which <span class="placeholder">switch</span> begins with a forward slash 
or hyphen and contains no colon, and <span class="placeholder">argument</span> 
consists of everything after the first colon (if any) in the option. </p>
<p>In the second syntax </p>
<blockquote>
  <p><span class="placeholder">switch</span>[<span class="switch">:</span><span class="placeholder">argument</span>[[<span class="switch">,</span><span class="placeholder">argument</span>]...]]<span class="switch">
  </span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>each <span class="placeholder">argument</span> now contains no comma, and may 
have the form </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>[<span class="placeholder">property</span><span class="switch">=</span>]<span class="placeholder">value</span><span class="switch">
  </span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>where <span class="placeholder">property</span> contains no equals sign and
<span class="placeholder">value</span> consists of everything after the first 
equals sign (if any) in the <span class="placeholder">argument</span>. </p>
<p>In descriptions of individual options, the first syntax is indicated by 
saying that the argument consists of everything after the colon. Otherwise, the 
multiple-argument syntax is meant, even if only one argument is permitted. </p>
<h2>Case </h2>
<p>Except where noted to the contrary, text in options is case-insensitive, both 
for the switches and for any keywords that are permitted among the arguments.
</p>
<h2>Numbers </h2>
<p>Also unless noted otherwise, numbers in arguments are decimal, or in 
C-language hexadecimal or octal notation. They are not permitted either a sign 
prefix or trailing non-numerical characters, and are evaluated as unsigned 
integers truncated to 32 bits. </p>
<h2>Errors and Warnings </h2>
<p>Two error conditions apply so generally that they will not even be mentioned 
elsewhere. First, it is a fatal error (LNK1146) if an option ends with its first 
colon. The one exception is that LIB explicitly disregards a trailing colon for 
the <span class="switch">/def</span> option. Second, it is a fatal error 
(LNK1117) if the initial forward slash or hyphen is followed immediately by a 
colon. </p>
<p>Some more conditions for errors and warnings are so typical that they are 
left as understood unless an exception is explicitly noted. </p>
<p>Where an option requires an argument (or arguments), failure to provide any 
(or enough) is typically a fatal error (LNK1146). Note that this applies to 
cases where the required arguments in the multiple-argument syntax are empty, as 
when a comma immediately follows the colon or another comma. </p>
<p>Where an option permits some number of arguments, provision of too many 
typically produces just a warning (LNK4056) that extra arguments are ignored. </p>
<p>The <span class="placeholder">property</span><span class="switch">=</span><span class="placeholder">value</span> 
syntax is meaningful to relatively few options, but not all disallow it 
explicitly. Where an argument is not shown as supporting this syntax, use of it 
is typically a fatal error (LNK1117). If the syntax is valid but the
<span class="placeholder">property</span> and equals sign are ignored, this will 
be noted as a curiosity about the argument. </p>
