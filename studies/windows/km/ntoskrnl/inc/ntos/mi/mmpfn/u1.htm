  <h1>MMPFN Union 1 </h1>
  <p>The <span class="struct"><a href="index.htm">MMPFN</a></span> (Memory Manager 
  Page Frame Number) structure is the key to pretty much everything that the Memory 
  Manager knows about a page of physical memory that is in general use. Since an 
  array of these structures for all physical memory needs to be kept in physical 
  memory, the <span class="struct">MMPFN</span> is its own substantial overhead. 
  Presumably to keep this down, ever more gets packed in to the
  <span class="struct">MMPFN</span> ever more intricately. </p>
  <p>However untidy the construction of the <span class="struct">MMPFN</span>, all 
  known versions have recognisably the same pointer-sized field at offset 0x00. 
  As a type, this field is an unnamed union. Members have come and gone and been 
  narrowed or widened, but some have been present through the whole history. </p>
  <p>Public symbol files for the kernel, starting with Windows 2000 SP3, name this 
  field as <span class="member">u1</span>. Before Windows 10, it’s a direct member 
  of the <span class="struct">MMPFN</span>. For Windows 10, talk of it as an
  <span class="struct">MMPFN</span> member is loose in that it is wrapped into an 
  unnamed structure in another unnamed union, and it is the latter that is directly 
  the <span class="member">MMPFN</span> member. Still, this complex nesting does 
  take the trouble to keep <span class="member">u1</span> at offset 0x00, compatibly 
  with its having been a direct member all along. That the union existed right from 
  the start is certain, since the kernel from version 3.10 uses the space variously 
  as the <span class="member">Flink</span>, <span class="member">WsIndex</span> 
  and <span class="member">Event</span> (at least). </p>

  <p>The <span class="member">Flink</span> is meaningful when the physical page 
  represented by the <span class="struct">MMPFN</span> is on any of several lists, 
  e.g., of free pages. It is specifically the PFN of the next physical page on the 
  same list. While 32-bit and 64-bit Windows need deal only with 36-bit and 48-bit 
  physical addresses, a PFN uses only 24 or 36 bits of its integral type: excess 
  bits can be used for other purposes concurrently. </p>
  <p>Starting with 64-bit Windows 8, pages on a standby list can also be linked 
  in a list just of pages that are on the same NUMA node. The ancient
  <span class="member">Flink</span> coexists with what might be named
  <span class="member">NodeFlink</span> except that the latter’s 36 bits are separated 
  into a <span class="member">NodeFlinkHigh</span> and a <span class="member">NodeFlinkLow</span>. 
  Only the high 28 bits are crammed in with the intact 36-bit
  <span class="member">Flink</span> at offset 0x00. The low 8 overlay the
  <span class="member">ViewCount</span> in the <span class="struct">MMPFN</span> 
  directly. </p>
  <p>The <span class="member">WsIndex</span> is a 0-based index into an array of
  <span class="struct">MMWSLE</span> structures. This index was widened from 32 
  bits to 64 for 64-bit Windows 8.1. Microsoft almost certainly defines a type for 
  this index. The KDEXTS.DLL debugger extension confirms with high confidence that 
  Microsoft’s name for this type is <span class="type">WSLE_NUMBER</span>. It is 
  originally a <span class="type">ULONG</span> but becomes a <span class="type">
  ULONG_PTR</span> for version 6.3 and higher. </p>
