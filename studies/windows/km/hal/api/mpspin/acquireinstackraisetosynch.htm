<h1>KeAcquireInStackQueuedSpinLockRaiseToSynch </h1>
<p>This function acquires a queued spin lock at low IRQL, raising to
<span class="constant">SYNCH_LEVEL</span>. </p>
<h2>Declaration </h2>
<pre class="source">VOID 
FASTCALL 
KeAcquireInStackQueuedSpinLockRaiseToSynch (
    KSPIN_LOCK *SpinLock, 
    KLOCK_QUEUE_HANDLE *LockHandle);</pre>
<h3>Parameters </h3>
<p>The <span class="argument">SpinLock</span> argument provides the address of the 
spin lock that is to be acquired. </p>
<p>The <span class="argument">LockHandle</span> argument provides the address of 
an opaque context structure. This address is re-presented when releasing the lock. 
The context must have no other use until the lock has been released. </p>
<h3>Constraints </h3>
<p>The <span class="function">KeAcquireInStackQueuedSpinLockRaiseToSynch</span> 
function assumes that the IRQL is no higher than <span class="constant">SYNCH_LEVEL</span>. 
It returns with the IRQL at <span class="constant">SYNCH_LEVEL</span>. The spin 
lock and the context structure must be in non-paged memory when this function begins 
and must remain so until the lock is released. </p>
<h2>Availability </h2>
<p>The <span class="function">KeAcquireInStackQueuedSpinLockRaiseToSynch</span> 
function is exported by name from x86 builds of the HAL in version 5.1 and higher 
and of the kernel in version 6.2 and higher. The HAL’s export in version 6.2 and 
higher is merely a forward to the kernel. </p>
<p>For 64-bit Windows, the <span class="function">KeAcquireInStackQueuedSpinLockRaiseToSynch</span> 
function is exported by name from the kernel in all known versions, i.e., starting 
with the version 5.2 from Windows Server 2003 SP1. </p>
<h2>Documentation Status </h2>
<p>The <span class="function">KeAcquireInStackQueuedSpinLockRaiseToSynch</span> 
function is not documented. </p>
<p>The synchronisation level is at best semi-documented. The first known definition 
of <span class="constant">SYNCH_LEVEL</span> in a Device Driver Kit (DDK) is in 
the NTDDK.H from the DDK for Windows NT 4.0, but it has come and gone, sometimes 
changing its numerical value, sometimes being defined for some processor architectures 
only. The Windows Driver Kit (WDK) for Windows 10 refers to it in comments and even 
in annotations, yet never defines it. These notes presently leave it for another 
time. </p>
<h2>Behaviour </h2>
<p>The <span class="function">KeAcquireInStackQueuedSpinLockRaiseToSynch</span> 
function is a compound. Its work is in two parts which can be done independently 
by calling exported functions or inlined routines: the first from the HAL (originally); 
the second from the kernel. The implementation gains by inlining its two parts and 
from skipping the second entirely for single-processor builds. </p>
<p>The first part is to raise the IRQL to <span class="constant">SYNCH_LEVEL</span> 
if it is not already there. This ensures that the current thread has exclusive use 
of the current processor. Interrupts can occur at higher IRQL, as with hardware 
interrupts, but they are not permitted to switch the processor to another thread. 
An equivalent exported function (x86) or inlined routine (x64) is
<span class="function">KeRaiseIrqlToSynchLevel</span>. </p>
<p>The second part is to arrange that the current processor has exclusive use of 
the protected resource. All threads that seek to use the resource must acquire the 
agreed lock. All call this function or a similar one so that all try to acquire 
the lock in the same way and are made to wait in a more or less tight loop until 
they own the lock. An equivalent exported function for this second part is
<span class="function">
<a href="../../../ntoskrnl/api/ke/queuelock/acquireinstackatdpclevel.htm">KeAcquireInStackQueuedSpinLockAtDpcLevel</a></span>. 
This part is trivial in single-processor builds. </p>
