<h1>CreateUrlCacheGroup </h1>
<p>This function creates a group in the Content cache container. </p>
<h2>Declaration </h2>
<pre class="source">GROUPID 
CreateUrlCacheGroup (
    DWORD dwFlags, 
    LPVOID lpReserved);</pre>
<h3>Parameters </h3>
<p>The <span class="argument">dwFlags</span> argument varies the behaviour of the 
function and may specify the behaviour of the created group. The following bits 
are permitted: </p>
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>0x01 </td>
    <td><span class="constant">CACHEGROUP_FLAG_NONPURGEABLE</span> </td>
    <td>create a sticky group </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>0x02 </td>
    <td><span class="constant">CACHEGROUP_FLAG_FLUSHURL_ONDELETE</span> </td>
    <td>accepted but meaningless </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>0x04 </td>
    <td><span class="constant">CACHEGROUP_FLAG_GIDONLY</span> </td>
    <td>allocate a group ID but do not create a group </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>The <span class="argument">lpReserved</span> argument must be NULL. </p>
<h3>Return Value </h3>
<p>If successful, the function returns a non-zero 64-bit identifier for the created 
group. The function returns 0 to indicate failure. An error code can be retrieved 
by calling <span class="function">GetLastError</span>. </p>
<h2>Behaviour </h2>
<p>If any invalid bit is set in <span class="argument">dwFlags</span> or if
<span class="argument">lpReserved</span> is not NULL, the function fails. </p>
<p>If URL caching is not yet initialised, it gets initialised as part of this function. 
Among other things, this involves loading the registry configuration of all cache 
containers in the applicable registry set and creating default groups in the Content 
container. If this initialisation fails, so too does the function. </p>
<p>This function works only with the Content container of the applicable registry 
set. If no Content container has been loaded, the function fails. The function also 
fails if it cannot secure its use of the Content container. </p>
<p>The <span class="constant">CACHEGROUP_FLAG_GIDONLY</span> bit in
<span class="argument">dwFlags</span> has precedence. If it is set, the function 
is not to go as far as creating a group but is instead to stop just at obtaining 
a group identifier as if for a new group. In practice, this cannot fail. If no group 
identifier has yet been allocated for this Content container (from previous calls 
to this function), then the current system time is saved as a
<span class="struct">FILETIME</span> in the container file’s header. Subsequently, 
this saved <span class="struct">FILETIME</span> is incremented for each new allocation. 
The group identifier is the 64 bits of this saved <span class="struct">FILETIME</span> 
but with the high 4 bits cleared. </p>
<p>Without the <span class="constant">CACHEGROUP_FLAG_GIDONLY</span> bit in
<span class="argument">dwFlags</span>, the function must find a free
<span class="struct">GROUP_ENTRY</span> structure in the container file, or create 
one. Failure at this is failure for the function. Having found a free
<span class="struct">GROUP_ENTRY</span> structure, the function obtains a group 
identifier as above, except that if the <span class="constant">CACHEGROUP_FLAG_NONPURGEABLE</span> 
bit is set in <span class="argument">dwFlags</span>, the group identifier gets its 
0x1000000000000000 bit set. Both the newly allocated group identifier and the given
<span class="argument">dwFlags</span> are saved in the <span class="struct">GROUP_ENTRY</span>, 
which is then the persistent record of the newly created group. In all future use 
of the group, non-purgeability is determined by the flag in the group identifier, 
not by the bit that is saved from the <span class="argument">dwFlags</span> argument.
</p>
<h3>Usage Notes </h3>
<p>Once a group is created with this function, additional properties can be set 
for it through the <span class="function">SetUrlCacheGroupAttribute</span> function 
and URL entries can be assigned to the group by calling <span class="function">SetUrlCacheEntryGroup</span>. 
Note that a URL entry can be assigned to multiple groups. To delete a group, call
<span class="function"><a href="deletegroup.htm">DeleteUrlCacheGroup</a></span>.
</p>
<p>The point to a sticky group, as created by specifying <span class="constant">
CACHEGROUP_FLAG_NONPURGEABLE</span>, is that URL entries automatically become sticky 
(in the sense that their cache entry type acquires the <span class="constant">STICKY_CACHE_ENTRY</span> 
flag) when assigned to a sticky group. </p>
<p>The Content container has one group created by default (internally, without using 
this function) as an essential part of initialising URL caching. This built-in group 
is sticky. It is semi-documented, its group ID being declared symbolically in WININETI.H 
as <span class="constant">CACHEGROUP_ID_BUILTIN_STICKY</span>. </p>
<h2>Availability </h2>
<p>The <span class="function">CreateUrlCacheGroup</span> function is exported by 
name from WININET.DLL version 4.71 and higher. It has long been documented. Note 
however that the documentation omits to mention that <span class="constant">CACHEGROUP_FLAG_NONPURGEABLE</span> 
is accepted. </p>
<p>The behaviour described in this note is of version 7.0 from the original Windows 
Vista. </p>
