  <h1>Expression Web: The Folder Name Is Not Valid </h1>
  <p>If you have installed Internet Information Services (IIS) from among the Windows 
  Features in Windows Vista, then you have an HTTP server running on your local 
  machine, with a Default Web Site that you can access in your browser of choice 
  using the URL http://<span class="placeholder">computername</span> or http://localhost. 
  If your browser is Internet Explorer, it may complain that “Intranet settings 
  are now turned off by default”, and you may do better to enable the Intranet zone 
  (with a careful choice of security settings) than to let the complaint recur. 
  If you want the site to be accessible from other computers on your intranet, you 
  may need to configure the Windows Firewall on your computer to make an exception 
  for World Wide Web Services (HTTP). Given that you have all this set up and working, 
  you might think that the Default Web Site is something you could open in Expression 
  Web. You would be wrong. You need the FrontPage Server Extensions, which Microsoft 
  no longer supplies. </p>
  <p>You can easily enough open the default page at the Default Web Site by typing 
  http://<span class="placeholder">computername</span> into the Open File dialog 
  (as reached from the File menu). If you haven’t yet done anything to the Default 
  Web Site, then the default page as set up by Windows Vista is titled simply IIS7 
  and shows a graphic with greetings in multiple languages. If instead you type 
  this same URL into the Open Site dialog (from the Site menu), all you get is a 
  distinctly unhelpful message box: </p>
  <img alt="The folder name is not valid." src="_images/badopensite.jpg" width="376" height="137">
  <p>See that although the URL is said to be invalid as a folder name, it is valid 
  enough for the program to have found the title of the default page at this URL. 
  Expression Web might not like what it finds for the name, but it evidently did 
  not think that the name itself is not valid. If you were testing Expression Web 
  at Microsoft, you would have to be unusually obtuse not to recognise that something 
  is wrong with this error message. </p>
  <p>To be fair, this silly error message “The folder name is not valid” is not 
  Expression Web’s. It comes instead from COMDLG32.DLL, which is the standard Windows 
  component that provides the common dialog for opening and saving files. But that 
  COMDLG32 has any sort of error to report, let alone this nonsense that “The folder 
  name is not valid”, is very much the work of executables that are installed with 
  Expression Web. </p>
  <p>Where the Open Site dialog shows the Network folder as having a subfolder named 
  Web Sites, this is because of a shell namespace extension, named FPNSE.DLL, which 
  is in the directory “<span class="placeholder">CommonProgramFiles</span>\microsoft 
  shared\Web Server Extensions\12\BIN”, where <span class="placeholder">CommonProgramFiles</span> 
  typically resolves as “C:\Program Files\Common Files”. </p>
