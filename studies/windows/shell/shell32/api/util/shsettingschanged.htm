<h1>SHSettingsChanged </h1>
<p>This function tells the shell that changes may have been made to one or more 
settings in some category. </p>
<h2>Declaration </h2>
<pre class="source">VOID
SHSettingsChanged (
    UINT Ignored,
    LPCWSTR lpCategory);</pre>
<h3>Parameters </h3>
<p>The first argument is ignored. Its only reason for being shown above as a
<span class="type">UINT</span> is that EXPLORER.EXE is known to pass as this 
argument the <span class="type">WPARAM</span> of a <span class="message">
WM_WININICHANGE</span> 
message. </p>
<p>The <span class="argument">lpCategory</span> argument provides the address of 
a null-terminated string that describes the category of settings that may have 
changed, or is NULL to indicate that all categories of settings may have 
changed. </p>
<h2>Behaviour </h2>
<p>At present, only one category of settings is recognised. It covers the 
SHELL32 and SHDOCVW restrictions, as read through the <span class="function">
<a href="shrestricted.htm">SHRestricted</a></span> and <span class="function">
<a href="../../../../ie/shdocvw/api/util/shrestricted2.htm">SHRestricted2</a></span> 
functions respectively. It is selected by either of the strings </p>
<ul>
  <li>Policy </li>
  <li>Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies </li>
</ul>
<p>the first being an overall description of the category and the second being 
the registry key in which most of these settings are saved. </p>
<p>If the <span class="argument">lpCategory</span> argument is NULL or addresses 
a string that matches one of the above in a case-insensitive comparison, then 
the shell increments its counter of changes to the restrictions. This is a
<a href="../../../shlwapi/api/gcount/index.htm">global counter</a>, as supported 
by SHLWAPI. Its name is known to both SHELL32 and SHDOCVW. When each is next 
asked for the value of any restriction, each will notice the change in the 
counter and they will each reset their cache of restriction values, so that a 
fresh value must be sought from the registry. </p>
<h2>Availability </h2>
<p>The <span class="function">SHSettingsChanged</span> function is exported from 
SHELL32 as ordinal 244 in version 4.71 and higher. </p>

<p>Though this function dates from as long ago as 1997, it was still not 
documented by Microsoft as late as the January 2007 edition of the Windows Vista 
Software Development Kit (SDK). </p>

<!--webbot bot="Include" i-checksum="56950" endspan -->
<p>Note that this function is an example of an Internet Explorer component, 
namely SHDOCVW.DLL, drawing (arguably important) functionality from a Windows 
component without actually calling any of the Windows component’s functions. It 
therefore escapes the requirements of Microsoft’s anti-trust settlement 
regarding API disclosure. Yet unarguably what happens here is that a Microsoft 
product, Internet Explorer, that has competitors accesses Microsoft’s monopoly 
product, Windows, to obtain a benefit that is unavailable to the competing 
products. </p>
