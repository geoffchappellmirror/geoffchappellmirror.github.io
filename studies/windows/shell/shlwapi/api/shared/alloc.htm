<h1>SHAllocShared </h1>
<p>This function creates a memory object for sharing data among processes. </p>
<h2>Declaration </h2>
<pre class="source">HANDLE
SHAllocShared (
    LPCVOID lpData,
    DWORD dwSize,
    DWORD dwProcessId);</pre>
<h3>Parameters </h3>
<p>The optional <span class="argument">lpData</span> argument provides the 
address of data to copy into the shared memory, or is NULL. </p>
<p>The <span class="argument">dwSize</span> argument provides the size of the 
shared memory area. If <span class="argument">lpData</span> is not NULL, then
<span class="argument">dwSize</span> is also the number of bytes that will be 
copied from <span class="argument">lpData</span> when initialising the shared 
memory area.
</p>
<p>The <span class="argument">dwProcessId</span> argument provides the process 
identifier (PID) of a process that is to participate in the sharing. </p>
<h3>Return Value </h3>
<p>If successful, the function returns a handle in the context of the given 
process. This handle may subsequently be given among the inputs to the other 
SHLWAPI functions that manage shared memory. </p>
<p>Otherwise, the function returns NULL. </p>
<h2>Behaviour </h2>
<p>The shared memory area lies within an unnamed file-mapping object backed by 
the paging file. The location of the shared memory within the file-mapping 
object is not formally specified. (Current implementations have a 16-byte header 
preceding the shared memory.) The function fails if it cannot create a 
sufficiently large file-mapping object or if it cannot map a view of that object 
into the current process’s address space. </p>
<p>If the <span class="argument">lpData</span> argument is not NULL, the 
function also copies <span class="argument">dwSize</span> bytes from
<span class="argument">lpData</span> to the shared memory area within the 
file-mapping object. </p>
<p>The function tries to obtain in the context of the process given by the
<span class="argument">dwProcessId</span> argument a handle to the file-mapping 
object. This is the handle that the function returns. It is clearly not intended 
that this handle be used directly to map a view of the file-mapping object, but 
should instead be treated as meaningful only to the other SHLWAPI functions that 
manage shared memory. </p>
<h2>Availability </h2>
<p>The <span class="function">SHAllocShared </span>function is exported from 
SHLWAPI.DLL as ordinal 7 in version 4.71 and higher. </p>
<!--webbot bot="Include" U-Include="../_include/undoc471.htm" TAG="BODY" startspan -->

<p>Though this function dates from as long ago as 1997, it was still not 
documented by Microsoft in the MSDN Library at least as late as the CD edition 
dated January 2004. </p>

<!--webbot bot="Include" i-checksum="43173" endspan -->
<p>The function also exists indirectly as an export from SHELL32.DLL. Indeed, 
this existence predates its implementation in SHLWAPI. The NT releases of 
SHELL32 version 4.00, as long ago as 1996, and all releases of later SHELL32 
versions export
<span class="function">SHAllocShared</span> as ordinal 520. From SHELL32 version 
4.71, the implementation in SHELL32 is just a jump to the corresponding 
implementation imported from SHLWAPI. Late builds of SHELL32 version 6.00 export 
the function by name. This change may be related to Microsoft’s programme of 
documenting interfaces for compliance with a consent decree. A SHELL32 function 
named
<span class="function">_SHAllocShared</span> was documented among the
<a target="_top" href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms807073.aspx">
Settlement Program Interfaces</a> in December 2002. The function is said there 
to require SHELL32 “version 5.0 or later”, as if to ignore three years or more 
of earlier existence. </p>
