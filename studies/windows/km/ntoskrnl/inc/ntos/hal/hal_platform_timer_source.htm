  <h1>HAL_PLATFORM_TIMER_SOURCE </h1>
  <p>The <span class="enum">HAL_PLATFORM_TIMER_SOURCE</span> (formally
  <span class="enum">_HAL_PLATFORM_TIMER_SOURCE</span>) is an enumeration that the 
  HAL uses to tell the kernel something of what hardware is the source of two important 
  measures of time. Its values persist most noticeably in the
  <span class="struct"><a href="../../shared/evntrace/trace_logfile_header.htm">
  TRACE_LOGFILE_HEADER</a></span> near the start of every kernel-mode Event Trace 
  Log (ETL) file. </p>
  <p>The kernel learns of the two timer sources by querying the HAL through the
  <span class="member">HalQuerySystemInformation</span> pointer in the
  <span class="struct"><a href="hal_dispatch.htm">HAL_DISPATCH</a></span>, giving
  <span class="constant">HalPlatformTimerInformation</span> as the
  <span class="enum">HAL_QUERY_INFORMATION_CLASS</span>. This fills a
  <span class="struct">HAL_PLATFORM_TIMER_INFORMATION</span> whose
  <span class="member">ClockInterruptSource</span> and <span class="member">PerformanceCounterSource</span> 
  are each a <span class="enum">HAL_PLATFORM_TIMER_SOURCE</span>. </p>
  <p>The information class <span class="constant">HalPlatformTimerInformation</span> 
  was introduced for Windows 7. The kernel’s one known use of it is to record the 
  sources in the <span class="struct">TRACE_LOGFILE_HEADER</span> when prepared 
  as the event-specific data for the system event <span class="constant">WMI_LOG_TYPE_HEADER</span> 
  (0x0000). Perhaps bizarrely, the sources go into the <span class="member">LoggerName</span> 
  and <span class="member">LogFileName</span> members. In earlier versions, these 
  actually are the addresses of strings</p>
  <h2>Documentation Status </h2>
  <p>The <span class="enum">HAL_PLATFORM_TIMER_SOURCE</span> enumeration is not 
  documented. The only C-language definition that Microsoft is known to have published 
  is in a header file named NTOSP.H from the original and Version 1511 editions 
  of the Windows Driver Kit (WDK) for Windows 10. </p>
  <p>If not for the possibly accidental disclosure of NTOSP.H, then even the existence 
  of the <span class="enum">HAL_PLATFORM_TIMER_SOURCE</span> as an enumeration might 
  still be unknown outside Microsoft: no symbol files are known to have type information 
  for this enumeration. </p>
  <p>That said, it turns out that type information for the <span class="enum">HAL_PLATFORM_TIMER_SOURCE</span> 
  has long been present in relatively plain sight—not in symbol files but in a statically 
  linked library, named CLFSMGMT.LIB, which Microsoft distributes with the Software 
  Development Kit for user-mode programming. </p>
  <h2>Values </h2>
  <p>The defined values and Microsoft’s names for them are known from the NTOSP.H 
  for just the two releases of Windows 10. Which earlier and later versions these 
  values are defined for, and whether later versions define more values, is in some 
  sense an open question. Inspection of any HAL tells only of which values are implemented 
  by that HAL, not which values might have been defined for a HAL to report if implementing 
  more types of clock. Type information in statically linked libraries tells of 
  what was defined in whatever headers the library was built with, whenever and 
  however the library was built, which need not match exactly with the operating 
  system the library is said to target. Still, these various sources happen to agree:
