<h1>Kernel Exports Added for Windows 10 Version 1511 </h1>
<p>This page lists the functions that are newly exported from the Windows kernel 
in its 1511 release. None at all were yet documented as showed at Microsoft’s website 
when searching on 27th February 2016. Repeating the survey on 7th October 2018 found 
that a few have been documented since. </p>
<!--webbot bot="Include" U-Include="../../_include/colours2.htm" TAG="BODY" startspan -->

<p>For the table below, documentation status is summarised by colour coding so that 
more detail can be given as Remarks with less text. (If you read this website with 
scripts enabled, then hovering the mouse over any coloured text will produce a tooltip 
that shows why the text is coloured.) Functions that have their own non-trivial 
documentation are shown with no background colour. Functions that appear to be completely 
undocumented are <span class="undocumented">highlighted yellow</span>. If a function 
is documented now but was not documented in the first contemporaneous Device Driver 
Kit (DDK), Windows Driver Kit (WDK) or Installable File System (IFS) Kit, then it 
is <span class="delayed">shaded yellow</span> to retain some of its previous status. 
Many undocumented functions do at least have C-language declarations in one or another 
header file from the WDK. These are <span class="declared">shaded orange</span>, 
except for one special case. Some declarations are known only from “minwin” headers 
that Microsoft published in early editions of the WDK for Windows 10 which seem 
since to have been withdrawn. These are <span class="minwin">highlighted orange</span> 
to indicate that public knowledge even of the declaration is exceptional. </p>

<!--webbot bot="Include" endspan i-checksum="15261" -->
<p>Many declarations of the new exports in version 1511 are inside conditional-compilation 
blocks that set a minimum <span class="macro">NTDDI_VERSION</span>. All such declarations 
date the function to some other release of Windows 10. Those that would have it 
that the function is not available until a later release do at least have the merit 
of matching the delayed documentation. </p>

<p>There was perhaps some plan that <span class="declared function">PsEqualCurrentServerSilo</span>,
<span class="delayed function">PsGetCurrentServerSilo</span> and
<span class="delayed function">PsIsCurrentThreadInServerSilo</span> should be exported 
from the kernel even in the original release of Windows 10. They are declared in 
NTDDK.H from the WDK for Windows 10 as if for export, but they exist in the corresponding 
kernel only as internal routines. </p>
<p>What documentation survives of <span class="delayed function">PsGetCurrentServerSiloName</span>,
<span class="declared function">PsGetCurrentSiloObject</span> and
<span class="delayed function">PsIsCurrentThreadInServerSilo</span> at Microsoft’s 
website (today, 17th September 2020) is separate from that of other silo functions, 
still warns that it “relates to pre-released product”, and now comes with the disclaimer 
that Microsoft is “no longer updating this content regularly.” The documentation 
is dated to 10th June 2016, which seems plausible as a date of first publication.

<p>Version 1511 also discontinued the export of some functions, including seven 
that had only just been introduced for the original <a href="names100.htm">version 
10.0</a>. These functions for working with silos were apparently so much in flux 
that <a href="names1607.htm">version 1607</a> discontinued more, including some 
that had been new for version 1511. </p>
