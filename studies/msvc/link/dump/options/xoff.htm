<h1>DUMPBIN /XOFF </h1>
<p>This option disables DUMPBIN’s highest level of exception handling. </p>
<!--webbot bot="Include" U-Include="../../_include/xoff-syntax.htm" TAG="BODY" startspan -->

<h2>Syntax </h2>
<p>No arguments are anticipated. The option is <span class="switch">/xoff</span> 
only. </p>

<!--webbot bot="Include" i-checksum="39989" endspan -->
<!--webbot bot="Include" U-Include="../../_include/xoff-behaviour.htm" TAG="BODY" startspan -->

<h2>Behaviour </h2>
<p>The exception handler in question is the one that reports LNK1000 internal errors 
to standard output, citing a procedure and following with a dump of exception information 
and CPU context. The <span class="switch">/xoff</span> option disables this handler 
for all exception codes other than the two that support delayed-load imports.
</p>

<h2>Comment </h2>
<p>This option is apparently undocumented. Its obvious merit is to help get information 
to Microsoft from users, perhaps programmers depending on Microsoft’s tools to help 
them with real work, who have the misfortune to encounter one of these LNK1000 internal 
errors. If the problem is reproducible, the user need simply re-run with this
<span class="switch">/xoff</span> option added. Then, the exception is let through 
to the standard dialog box that gathers information about the fault, presumably 
in a form that Microsoft has designed to be most generally helpful, and which even 
offers to send this information to Microsoft. </p>

<h3>Demonstration </h3>
<p>To see this option in action, one needs to know of a coding error that is bad 
enough to cause a fault. The <a href="../dumpsymbolmap.htm">Internal error 
during DumpSymbolMap</a> is arguably obscure, as most such coding errors surely 
are in Microsoft’s products, but makes for a good demonstration of <span class="switch">
/xoff</span> since it seems likely to apply to a wide range of versions and 
therefore be accessible to a wide range of readers over a wide time. Try it with
<span class="switch">/xoff</span> and without. </p>
