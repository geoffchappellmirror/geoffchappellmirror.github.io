  <h1>EXTRACT.EXE Misses Files in Cabinet </h1>
  <h2>Background </h2>
  <p>With Windows 95, if not earlier, Microsoft introduced a scheme by which a set 
  of files may be compressed into one or more cabinet files (with the .CAB extension) 
  for easy distribution. Windows 95 is itself distributed as a series of these cabinet 
  files. Windows 95 also supplies a program with which users may operate on cabinet 
  files, especially to get a directory of the cabinet’s contents or to extract files 
  of particular interest. This utility program is called EXTRACT.EXE. That this 
  program is a standard component of a Windows 95 installation makes it very convenient 
  to distribute files in cabinets. </p>
  <p>EXTRACT.EXE is a DOS program with a command line syntax. Of special interest 
  to this bug note is that the syntax allows users to follow the name of the cabinet 
  with one or more templates for the names of files that the program is to search 
  for in the cabinet. These templates may simply be filenames or they may include 
  wildcard characters. If the user supplies no template, the program uses *.* by 
  default. </p>
  <h2>Problem </h2>
  <p>Some versions of the EXTRACT.EXE program do not give *.* the conventional meaning 
  of matching all filenames. Instead, the program interprets *.* as matching files 
  whose names contain exactly one period. Whenever the EXTRACT program uses *.* 
  as the template for matching files, it will miss files whose names have no extension 
  (and files whose names have more than one period). </p>
  <h3>Applicable Versions </h3>
  <p>This note applies to versions 1.00.0520 and 1.00.0530. The latter is the more 
  common, being distributed with Windows 95 (both the original release and OSR2) 
  and with many Microsoft applications. Dates and times for the file vary with the 
  package. The file size varies also, depending on whether the executable is compressed. 
  Version 1.00.0520 was distributed with Microsoft Office for Windows 95. To determine 
  the version of a given EXTRACT.EXE file, execute it with either no command-line 
  arguments or with the <span class="switch">/?</span> switch. </p>
  <p>The version 1.00.0603 distributed with Internet Explorer 4.0 does not exhibit 
  the problem described here. </p>
  <h2>Work Around </h2>
  <p>There is no template that the faulty versions of EXTRACT.EXE will interpret 
  as matching all possible filenames. However, all filenames that are valid under 
  traditional DOS rules will be matched by running the EXTRACT program twice—once 
  in the usual way with either *.* or with no template, and once with the template 
  * in case the cabinet contains files that have no extension. </p>
  <h3>Example </h3>
  <p>If a user is given a cabinet file, say ARCHIVE.CAB, then the command
  <span class="command">extract archive.cab *.*</span> (or its equivalent
  <span class="command">extract /e archive.cab</span>) cannot be relied on to extract 
  all the contents of the cabinet. However, the command <span class="command">extract 
  archive.cab *.*</span> can be followed by <span class="command">extract archive.cab 
  *</span> to pick up any files whose names happen not to contain a period. </p>
  <h2>Cause </h2>
  <p>The cause is confirmed to lie in the EXTRACT.EXE code—specifically in the routine 
  that matches a given filename against a given template. The implementation of 
  how characters in the template are to match characters in the filename is: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>The wildcards are the asterisk and the question mark. </li>
    <li>An asterisk (along with zero or more wildcards in any order immediately 
    after the first asterisk) matches any zero or more characters except for a period 
    or the character (if any) that follows the wildcard (or wildcards) in the template.
    </li>
    <li>A question mark matches any one character except for a period. </li>
    <li>Any character that is not a wildcard matches any one character that has 
    the same mapping to upper case. (This is a simple case map that applies only 
    to the lower case letters of the English alphabet.) </li>
  </ul>
  <p>In particular, a period in the template matches only a period in the filename 
  and conversely, a period in the filename can be matched only by a period in the 
  template. The template *.* is therefore interpreted as matching filenames that 
  contain exactly one period. </p>
  <h2>Fix </h2>
  <p>In version 1.00.0603, the routine that matches a given filename against a given 
  template starts with new code—almost certainly just one line of C—that returns 
  a successful match, whatever the filename, if given *.* as the template. </p>
  <p>The Windows problem described in this note has therefore been fixed by Microsoft, 
  the solution being to upgrade Windows by installing Internet Explorer 4.0. Careful 
  inspection of the Microsoft Knowledge Base may one day show that the problem is 
  not only fixed but documented (as one would think it would be, at least while 
  faulty versions of EXTRACT.EXE remain in circulation). </p>
