<h1>The Shell Light-Weight API </h1>
<p>Some time at least as long ago as mid-1996, Microsoft started gathering a 
collection of mostly small and mostly self-contained functions for a shell 
utility library. Many of these functions had previous implementations in the 
Windows 95 or NT 4.0 versions of either the shell itself (SHELL32.DLL) or the 
common controls library (COMCTL32.DLL) or both. </p>
<p>The result, named SHLWAPI.DLL, seems to have been released first for Windows 
95 OSR2 and Internet Explorer 3.0. It has ever since been a core component of 
the standard shell in those Windows operating systems that derive from DOS, but 
did not become a core NT component until Windows 2000. </p>
<p>SHLWAPI has shipped with all subsequent releases of Internet Explorer. 
Indeed, its functionality seems to have expanded most for releases of Internet 
Explorer rather than of any operating system. A significant expansion was 
released in Internet Explorer 4.0 well ahead of Windows 98. Another was released 
in Internet Explorer 5.0 well ahead of Windows 2000 (and even a little ahead of 
the relatively minor Windows 98 Second Edition). This fits broadly with other 
reasons to infer at Microsoft an attitude, sustained over several years, that 
customers of Microsoft’s operating systems who want to upgrade their operating 
system might best do so by acquiring Microsoft’s web browser. </p>
