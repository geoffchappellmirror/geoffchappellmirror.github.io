/*  Background  */

/*  A "document" is an essentially arbitrary page at this website. It is 
    written as its own content but may be (and ideally is) presented in some 
    sort of viewer. What this means now, if not forever, is that the 
    document shows in one pane (or panel) along with others for a banner 
    across the top and a Table of Contents (TOC) to the left. Getting the 
    document into the viewer is the primary business of this script. Without 
    this script, the document shows in the whole of the browser window (or 
    in whatever frame someone else's site has tried to host it in). 

    It cannot be stressed enough how important is the preceding design. 
    Pages at this site must be preparable as naturally as possible in an 
    HTML editor for self-standing presentation, both for the author's 
    convenience when writing them and especially so that they show 
    acceptably to users who disable scripting. 

    Required Stylesheets and Scripts 
    -------------------------------- 

    The implementation here requires that every document page has a HEAD 
    that loads at least two stylesheets and two scripts. The reason for 
    having two of each is that the first (MASTER.CSS and MASTER.JS) contain 
    whatever is imagined might be used not just in the second (DOCUMENT.CSS 
    and DOCUMENT.JS) but also in scripts and stylesheets for pages that 
    aren't intended as document pages (notably, BANNER.HTM and the various 
    TOC.HTM pages). 

    Document pages may load more scripts, of course, but for as long as 
    pages at this site have loaded any scripts at all, MASTER.JS and 
    DOCUMENT.JS have been the minimal requirement. Thousands of pages have 
    been prepared on this basis. These are not any time soon, if ever, going 
    to be edited and re-uploaded. Thus does loading MASTER.JS and 
    DOCUMENT.JS remain the minimal requirement. 

    Scripting for the document page's interactivity has been moved to a new 
    script named DOCUI.JS. This gets loaded by all document pages but not 
    directly by themselves. It is instead loaded by this script as its last 
    work on first execution. Also loaded by this script is a new stylesheet 
    named VIEWER.CSS whose rules are meaningful only for a document page 
    that has been re-presented in the viewer. 

    No DEFER Attribute 
    ------------------ 

    Rebuilding the DOM tree to re-present the document in the viewer does 
    quite some violence to the layout. It's not in anyone's interests to 
    have the document page show, even fleetingly, styled or not, in advance 
    of the scripts getting to work. Therefore, we really do want that the 
    SCRIPT tag for DOCUMENT.JS does not have the DEFER attribute. 

    Be clear on this point. To specify DEFER for these scripts tells the 
    browser to request the scripts asynchronously and proceed immediately to 
    showing the document - all of Style calculation, Layout and Paint in 
    Internet Explorer, and Recalculate Style, Layout and Pre-Paint and Paint 
    in the Chromium Edge - before the scripts have even been downloaded, let 
    alone before they get to execute.  */

/*  *************  */
/*  Configuration  */

/*  Historically, the viewer truly was a frameset, i.e., with FRAMESET and 
    FRAME nodes. Go back far enough and the scheme depended on a VIEWER.HTM 
    that provided the frameset as HTML. This was scrapped in 2011 to build 
    the frameset dynamically. Still, the history persists in that the viewer 
    and its banner, TOC and document panels are sometimes still referred to 
    as a frameset and frames - both in comments and in the names of 
    functions and variables. 

    Each "frame" has a name - once upon a time truly the NAME attribute of a 
    FRAME - so that scripts running in the frames can identify that they are 
    in the correct frame. Each name was also an ID (and is still, but now of 
    an IFRAME or DIV). This ID must match with VIEWER.CSS. Each also names a 
    property of the Viewer object that is built by this script. 

    Since 2021, the viewer is instead a set of BODY, DIV and IFRAME nodes. A 
    document page starts with a straightforward DOM tree of nodes created 
    from tags in some straightforward HTML: 

    HTML
      HEAD
      BODY
        content 

    This script rearranges this part of the tree to: 

    HTML                id="Viewer"             original, with new ID
      HEAD                                      original, edited inside
      BODY              id="ViewerBody"         original, reworked beneath
        DIV             id="TopRow"
          DIV           id="BannerDiv"
            IFRAME      id="BannerFrame"        src="banner.htm"
        DIV             id="MainRow"
          DIV           id="TocDiv"
            IFRAME      id="TocFrame"           src="toc.htm"
          DIV           id="TocDocDiv"
          DIV           id="DocDiv"
            DIV         id="DocFrame"
              content                           from BODY

    The TopRow is in some sense superfluous, existing just for the symmetry 
    of having all the *Frame nodes (whether IFRAME or DIV) at the same 
    depth. 

    In another sense it is one of the viewer's three key contact points. The 
    TopRow and MainRow at the top of the tree are the viewer's attachment 
    points to the BODY (such that they become the BODY's only children). The 
    DocFrame at the bottom is the attachment site for the BODY's original 
    children, i.e., what the reader perceives as the document's content. 

    The viewer, then, is the TopRow, MainRow and DocFrame and everything 
    in-between (short of peering into the IFRAME nodes). Each node in this 
    viewer has an ID which gets its styling from VIEWER.CSS.  */

    frames. In all these cases, what's loaded is only from elsewhere at this 
    website. For all other types of resource that are subject to the policy, 
    the site never loads anything at all, not even from itself. 

    And there it ends for almost all document pages. The base-uri and 
    form-action policies are added explicitly because they are not covered 
    by falling back to default-src. 

    Any document page that needs a more relaxed CSP, e.g., to support 
    DEMO.JS, must set its own META in the HTML. Notably, DEMO.JS needs 
    both 'unsafe-eval' 'unsafe-inline' as additions for script-src. 

    If the CSP is set at the server to send in all HTTP Response Headers, it 
    will need to be no more strict than the least strict of any META. 

    TO DO: 

    There may be some question of precedence. A META cannot relax a policy 
    from the headers, but it's unclear that strengthening is always 
    respected. Some experimentation looks to be required: not only have the 
    promoters of the Content Security Policy not been nearly as definitive 
    as might be wanted but they also didn't provide an easy means of 
    discovering what policy applies.  */

/*  Revision in 2021 created a new stylesheet and a new script that are both 
    to be loaded by every document page. This has in turn required some 
    editing of the HEAD. 

    The new stylesheet, VIEWER.CSS, is specialised to the presentation of 
    document pages in the viewer. To have every document page load this 
    stylesheet would be a waste, at best, when scripts don't run. Anyway, 
    the site's thousands of pages will not any time soon be edited and 
    re-uploaded to the live server. This consideration applies also to the 
    new script, DOCUI.JS, which is specialised to the common interactivity 
    of all document pages when presented in the viewer. The new stylesheet 
    and script are therefore loaded dynamically by this script. The 
    standards are not known to leave any way to add a stylesheet dynamically 
    except by editing an appropriate LINK into the HEAD. 

    The work is split into the general and the particular. The general was 
    for a while exposed also to TOC.JS since it also has a new script for 
    interactivity. Though this is not needed now, all seven TOC.HTM files 
    having been edited and uploaded, the separation is retained for its 
    neatness.  */

    respectively). 

    The HEAD is sure to exist and its nodes are sure to reach the SCRIPT tag 
    that got the caller's script loaded. More importantly, since the browser 
    is known to be still working on the HEAD (being still some way from even

        mobile phones so that this META tag is appropriate.

    Were we to do the lot in one go, then the algorithm that has the fewest 
    moves and is the fastest yet seen in tests is: first, insert the 
    viewer's new nodes, i.e., the two small trees under the TopRow and 
    MainRow, at the start of the BODY; then, move the BODY's original 
    children to the DocFrame at the end of what we inserted. 

    An alternative is to move all the BODY's original children to the 
    DocFrame (or to a document fragment) first and then hope to gain for 
    appending to an emptied BODY. The original children then move twice, 
    which shows in tests, especially if the children are numerous and have 
    deep trees of descendants. Internet Explorer has much trouble on this 
    point. But done this way the work can be broken into parts for 
    synchronising better with the browser's other work. 

    Very plausibly, more thinking and experimentation is required to find 
    the optimal algorithm. 

    Whatever we end up with, note that although the number of children to 
    move is not the dominant factor, it clearly is an important factor. 
    There would be far fewer calls to the browser if all our documents were 
    prepared with the P and similar tags of their main text in a DIV (or 
    MAIN) instead of directly in the BODY. Though the time needed is 
    certainly not determined just by the number of calls, a point of 
    procedure for the HTML authoring is worth establishing: whenever a page
