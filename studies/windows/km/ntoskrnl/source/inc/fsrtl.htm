  <p>The header FSRTL.H is not known in any Device Driver Kit (DDK) or Windows Driver 
  Kit (WDK). </p>
  <h2>Reconstruction </h2>
  <p>For one of the types that the kernel’s public symbols show as defined in FSRTL.H, 
  a C-language definition has slipped out in a header named NTOSIFS.H which Microsoft 
  published with the WDK for Windows 10 in its original and Version 1511 editions. 
  Perusal of this otherwise unpublished header suggests that some of the surrounding 
  content—roughly a hundred lines before and hundreds after—may also come from the 
  unseen FSRTL.H or have a common source. </p>
  <p>Whether content is extracted from FSRTL.H to NTOSIFS.H or both are extracted 
  from yet some other input, the effect looks to be that successive lines of FSRTL.H 
  are either duplicated or not in NTOSIFS.H, such that the latter has a contiguous 
  region of lines that are each in FSRTL.H. Matching the line numbers for type definitions 
  as seen in NTOSIFS.H with FSRTL.H line numbers deduced from public symbols would 
  then support a reasonable attempt at reconstructing much of what the unseen FSRTL.H 
  must have between its type definitions. </p>
  <p>The bad news for this is that in the whole of the downloadable package of public 
  symbols for the original Windows 10, only the PDB file for the kernel has type 
  information that’s cited as having come from FSRTL.H and, as seen above, this 
  tells of only one type. The good news is that more type information turns up in 
  a statically linked library that Microsoft supplies with the Software Development 
  Kit (SDK). The library is named CLFSMGMT.LIB. Some of the object files that it 
  archives are for linking into kernel-mode drivers. The corresponding source files 
  evidently and perhaps even naturally included Microsoft’s private FSRTL.H. Fortunately, 
  these files were built using a pre-compiled header and the library also archives 
  an object file that was a by-product of creating the pre-compiled header. It thus 
  records not only the types that were regarded as used for any compilation of a 
  source file but all the types that might get used: </p>
