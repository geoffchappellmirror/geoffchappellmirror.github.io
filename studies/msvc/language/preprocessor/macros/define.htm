<h1>Macro Definition </h1>
<p>Macros can be defined and undefined through various mechanisms. The full 
generality is available through the preprocessor directives <span class="directive">
#define</span> 
and <span class="directive">#undef</span> in source text (i.e., in a source file 
or header file). An important special case is supported from the command line, 
through the <span class="switch"><a href="../../../cl/cl/options/d.htm">/D</a></span> 
and
<span class="switch"><a href="../../../cl/cl/options/u.htm">/U</a></span> 
options.
</p>
<p>A handful of macros are defined internally by the compiler and thereafter 
treated as reserved, so that they cannot be redefined or undefined. These
<a href="builtin/index.htm">built-in macros</a> conform to the definition 
discussed here but some behave specially when expanded. Microsoft documents some 
of these built-in macros as predefined. </p>
<p>For clarity, it is perhaps as well to mention now that other macros said by 
Microsoft to be predefined are not built-in but are instead defined through
<span class="switch">/D</span> options generated by CL.EXE either by default, as 
with <span class="switch">/D_MSC_VER=1300</span>, or in response to other 
options, as with <span class="switch"><a href="../../../cl/cl/options/j.htm">/J</a></span> 
implying
<span class="switch">/D_CHAR_UNSIGNED</span>. To the actual compiler (C1XX.DLL), 
a macro definition produced internally by CL.EXE is indistinguishable from the 
same macro definition given explicitly on the CL.EXE command line and passed 
through to the compiler. These predefined macros therefore receive no 
significance in these notes. For a list of the known predefined macros, see <span class="switch">
<a href="../../../cl/cl/options/$u.htm">/u</a></span>, which is supposed to 
undefine them all before C1XX can ever see them. </p>
<p>The defining elements of a macro are its name, argument list and body. </p>
<h2>Name </h2>
<p>The name must be valid as an identifier. The only identifier that cannot name 
a macro is <span class="keyword">defined</span>. </p>
<h2>Argument List </h2>
<p>The argument list is a set of identifiers that serve as formal parameters for 
the macro. It is not necessary that a macro have an argument list. It is 
permitted that the argument list be empty, which is distinct from the argument 
list being omitted. </p>
