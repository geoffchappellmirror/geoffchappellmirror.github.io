<h1>The #include Directive </h1>
<h2>Syntax </h2>
<blockquote>
  <p><span class="directive">#include &quot;</span>[<span class="placeholder">path-spec</span>]<span class="directive">&quot;</span>
  </p>
  <p><span class="directive">#include &lt; </span>[<span class="placeholder">path-spec</span>]<span class="directive"> 
  &gt;</span> </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The general syntax of <a href="index.htm">preprocessor directives</a> applies 
as far as ending <span class="directive">include</span>. Thereafter, the first 
token must be either a string constant or a less-than sign. Any other type of 
token is an error (C2006). </p>
<p>In the first form shown above, the string constant has
<span class="placeholder">path-spec</span> enclosed in double quotes. A 
wide-character constant is an error (C2002). The <span class="placeholder">
path-spec</span> is optional in the sense that an empty string is permitted. </p>
<p>In the second form, the less-than token may be followed by any amount of 
white space, including none. The optional <span class="placeholder">path-spec</span> 
then begins and continues up to and including the last character that is not 
white space immediately before a greater-than sign. It is an error (C2012) if 
there is nothing but white space after the less-than token. It is an error 
(C2013) if there is no greater-than sign after the less-than token. If there is 
nothing but white space between the less-than token and the greater-than sign, 
then
<span class="placeholder">path-spec</span> is empty. </p>
<h3>Translation Precedence </h3>
<p>In the form with double-quotes, the <span class="directive">#include</span> 
argument is fully tokenised. It is therefore unremarkable, except perhaps to 
stress that the argument provides for just one string constant, as one token, 
not as a concatenation of tokens. </p>
<p>The other form (with angle-brackets) is tokenised only at its start. This is 
enough so that the less-than token and subsequent characters may be produced by 
macro expansion. For example, the <span class="placeholder">path-spec</span> for
</p>
<pre class="source">#include    TEST_HEADER</pre>
<p>can be set from the command line through some such option as </p>
<pre class="input">/D TEST_HEADER=&quot;&lt;test.h&gt;&quot;</pre>
<p>and varied without having to edit the source file. The macro expansion may 
produce the whole of the <span class="directive">#include</span> argument, as in 
the preceding example, or just an initial portion. For example, </p>
<pre class="source">#define     TEST    &lt;test

#include    TEST.h&gt;</pre>
<p>though contrived, is valid. </p>
