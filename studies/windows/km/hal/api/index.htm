  <h1>Windows HAL Exports </h1>
  <p>This page lists all the functions and variables that appear in the export directory 
  of any known i386 (x86) or amd64 (x64) build of the Hardware Abstraction Layer 
  (HAL) in Windows. Many have been or still are exported from the HAL for other 
  processor architectures, but x86 and x64 account for very nearly all Windows computers 
  whose users actually do think of and use their computers as computers, in contrast 
  to phones, devices and things. So, only x86 and x64 matter to this study. </p>
  <p>Many HAL functions are arguably a private matter between the HAL and the kernel, 
  and would not usefully be documented for programmers outside Microsoft’s few who 
  work on the HAL and kernel. As a quick summary, you may care to know that just 
  under one half of all HAL exports are documented, and the majority of these are 
  documented as reserved or obsolete. Indeed, since Windows 2000 made many of the 
  early functions obsolete, there have been 55 additions to the HAL’s interface 
  but only five are documented for non-Microsoft use. </p>
  <p>This page’s table is intended only as a master list. For each name, the table 
  gives just a brief summary of the applicable HAL versions and a colour-coded summary 
  of status with respect to Microsoft’s documentation. Details of an export’s availability 
  and documentation history may be found by looking for the export in other lists, 
  according to its first version as shown here. In the Table of Contents, expand 
  the HAL’s entry for <a href="../history/index.htm">History</a> to get pages on 
  the exports for each version. </p>
  <!--webbot bot="Include" U-Include="../../_include/colours-index.htm" TAG="BODY" startspan -->

<p>Documentation status is summarised by colour coding. <span class="ScriptOnly">
(To decode a colour, hover for a tooltip.) </span><span class="NoScript">(Had the 
website’s scripts run as expected, then hovering over any colour-coded text would 
produce a tooltip that shows why the text is coloured.) </span></p>
<p>Functions that have their own non-trivial documentation are shown with no background 
colour, this documentation status being completely unremarkable. </p>
<p>Functions that are documented as reserved or obsolete are
<span class="reserved">shaded red</span> or <span class="obsolete">shaded grey</span>, 
respectively, as quick indications that they are better avoided. </p>
<p>To make an obvious contrast, which is used throughout this website, functions 
that appear to be completely undocumented are <span class="undocumented">highlighted 
yellow</span>. If a function is documented now but was not documented in the first 
contemporaneous Device Driver Kit (DDK), Windows Driver Kit (WDK) or Installable 
File System (IFS) Kit, then it is <span class="delayed">shaded yellow</span> to 
retain some of its previous status. </p>
<p>Many undocumented functions do at least have C-language declarations in one or 
another header file from the WDK. These are <span class="declared">shaded orange</span>. 
They are not formally documented, nor formally reserved, but neither are they completely 
undocumented: indeed, history shows they’re often on the way to getting documented. 
Some undocumented functions aren’t declared in any WDK header now but had declarations 
disclosed by Microsoft in a “minwin” subdirectory of early editions of the WDK for 
Windows 10 which seem since to have been withdrawn. These are
<span class="minwin">highlighted orange</span> to indicate that public disclosure 
even of the declaration was exceptional. </p>

<!--webbot bot="Include" endspan i-checksum="7863" -->
  <p>That a function or variable is exported in all versions of the applicable architecture 
  is often some sign of its being fundamental and seems deserving of an easy indication. 
  The shorthand “all” means “3.10 and higher” for the x86 and “5.2 SP1 and higher” 
  for the x64. When clearly limited just to the x64, version 5.2 is treated as beginning 
  with SP1. </p>
  <p>More notes follow the table. </p>

    </table>
    <p>There has been a slow migration of functionality from the HAL to the kernel. 
    Starting with Windows XP, some HAL functions are also exported from the kernel. 
    The overlap of names is indicated below by an “also from kernel” annotation. 
    For details of whether the HAL retains an implementation or merely forwards 
    its export to the kernel, follow the function into the History lists. </p>
    <p>The introduction of x64 support brought with it such a rethink of functional 
    division between the kernel and HAL that some of the x86 HAL’s exports never 
    are taken up by the x64 HAL but are instead exported only from the kernel. Since 
    they are not HAL exports, they might be omitted from the table, but to help 
    with cross-referencing they are indicated below by an x64-specific direction 
    to “see kernel”. </p>
    <p>The 2004 release of Windows 10 reduces the x64 HAL to a stub. All exports 
    from the x64 HAL for 2004 and higher are also exported from the kernel. They 
    are exported from the HAL only as forwards to the same-named export from the 
    kernel. The x86 HAL is, as yet, unaffected. </p>
    <h2>Names </h2>
    <p>Names are reproduced from the export directory of the HAL.DLL executable. 
    All exports from the HAL are by name. </p>
    <p>A few exports are of variables rather than functions. They are marked above 
    by the word “data” in parentheses. These notes talk of all as functions, hoping 
    no confusion will be caused by the loose terminology. </p>
    <!--webbot bot="Include" U-Include="../../_include/exports.htm" TAG="BODY" startspan -->

<p>Since experience shows that this table is not always read with the knowledge 
of an advanced programmer, it must be stressed that a function’s presence in the 
export directory does not mean that the function is implemented non-trivially, let 
alone that it will work satisfactorily if called. It means just that the function 
can be imported by other modules, and be called by them, for better or worse. That 
a function is first exported in some version does not mean that Microsoft supports 
its use in that version, even if such support is documented for later versions.
</p>

<!--webbot bot="Include" endspan i-checksum="45945" -->
    <h2>Versions </h2>
    <p>The <a href="../history/index.htm">HAL versions</a> shown for each function 
    are inferred from a study of public releases such as I have managed to find 
    on MSDN discs or downloaded from Microsoft’s websites, whether free or requiring 
    what is nowadays called a Visual Studio subscription. My holdings are incomplete, 
    especially for service packs of the earliest versions, and I anyway have no 
    time for (or interest in) examining pre-release builds or post-release fixes, 
    patches and updates. Of necessity then, the table makes what I hope are reasonable 
    assumptions about likely continuity, especially to suppose that a function will 
    exist in future versions or that a function exists in all builds of a version 
    if no counter-example is yet known. If you want more accurate or comprehensive 
    information, try getting it from Microsoft. </p>
    <h2>Documentation </h2>
    <p>The foundation for all comment on Microsoft’s documentation of exported HAL 
    functions is what looks to be Microsoft’s last packaging of WDK documentation 
    to download for offline reference through Visual Studio under the heading “Windows 
    Driver Kit (WDK)”. As this documentation says: “Windows Driver Kit (WDK) 10 
    is integrated with Microsoft Visual Studio 2015”. The large file, named v2Windows_Development_Windows_Driver_Development_B974_VS_85_en-us_3.mshc, 
    from which this integrated content is drawn appears to be as close as Microsoft 
    now comes to publishing WDK documentation as a self-standing, explicitly dated 
    collection. The file’s last modification date is 6th August 2015, which to my 
    mind means it can reasonably be taken as Microsoft’s definitive offering of 
    documentation for Windows 10 as first released on 29th July 2015. </p>
    <p>What I know of any later WDK documentation is whatever I happen to have found 
    at Microsoft’s website in occasional visits for which I can’t summon much commitment. 
    Perhaps there is a better way, perhaps there are still packages to download 
    for integration into Visual Studio, but I never have welcomed downloading the 
    WDK and then having to go hunting for the related documentation. </p>
