<h1>HAL Exports Added For Version 6.2 </h1>
<p>This page lists all the exports that were added to the HAL for version 6.2, i.e., 
for Windows 8. </p>
<!--webbot bot="Include" U-Include="../../_include/colours2.htm" TAG="BODY" startspan -->

<p>For the table below, documentation status is summarised by colour coding so that 
more detail can be given as Remarks with less text. (If you read this website with 
scripts enabled, then hovering the mouse over any coloured text will produce a tooltip 
that shows why the text is coloured.) Functions that have their own non-trivial 
documentation are shown with no background colour. Functions that appear to be completely 
undocumented are <span class="undocumented">highlighted yellow</span>. If a function 
is documented now but was not documented in the first contemporaneous Device Driver 
Kit (DDK), Windows Driver Kit (WDK) or Installable File System (IFS) Kit, then it 
is <span class="delayed">shaded yellow</span> to retain some of its previous status. 
Many undocumented functions do at least have C-language declarations in one or another 
header file from the WDK. These are <span class="declared">shaded orange</span>, 
except for one special case. Some declarations are known only from “minwin” headers 
that Microsoft published in early editions of the WDK for Windows 10 which seem 
since to have been withdrawn. These are <span class="minwin">highlighted orange</span> 
to indicate that public knowledge even of the declaration is exceptional. </p>

<h2>Discontinued </h2>
<p>Version 6.2 discontinues two functions. One,
<span class="undocumented function">HalCallBios</span> dates from version 5.2 (and 
only then in 64-bit builds). Another, <span class="undocumented function">HalMcUpdateReadPCIConfig</span>, 
was introduced only as recently as version 6.1. </p>
