  <h1>Geoff Chappell, Software Analyst </h1>
  <p>You are at the home page of a website that has grown over decades from an academic 
  interest in studying what software actually does. Sadly, what software actually 
  does is much too often not exactly what the manufacturer says the software does.
  </p>
  <h2>Reverse Engineering </h2>
  <p>You should know up front that <span class="highlight">pretty much everything 
  at this website has been obtained by reverse engineering computer software</span> 
  from commercial manufacturers, not so their ideas can be stolen and reworked, 
  but so the actual working of what they sell can be discovered and reported for 
  public benefit. </p>
  <p>I say my work is critical analysis, but if you think that reverse engineering 
  can only be theft, then turn away now—or, better, browse this website’s thousands 
  of pages to learn differently. </p>
  <h2>Readership </h2>
  <p>The software examined here is almost always Microsoft Windows or one of Microsoft’s 
  programming tools for Windows. </p>
  <p>Very little that I write about this software is intended for a general readership. 
  If anything, almost all is at the other extreme: <span class="highlight">I take 
  as granted that you have a sound understanding of advanced Windows programming</span> 
  in general and a good knowledge of what Microsoft has already documented of the 
  particular topic. It has to be this way, not just from my disposition and temperament 
  but for the practical matter that I could not otherwise get to the detail that 
  Microsoft’s documentation does not. </p>
  <p>Where I do cover material that Microsoft documents, it is not at all unusual 
  that what I write conflicts with Microsoft’s documentation. That is much of the 
  point to my proceeding with the intensive research that backs up the writing:
  <span class="highlight">you should be able to rely on me to be correct and Microsoft 
  to be mistaken</span>, because Microsoft at best documents what its programmers 
  thought they coded into the software but my aim is to document what actually is 
  there. </p>
  <h2>Research </h2>
  <p>This is resolutely not one of those many websites that collate suppositions 
  from who knows where on the Internet. Though I may slip up now and then, my intention 
  is that <span class="highlight">all the substantive work at this site is original 
  research into primary sources</span>, unless another source is noted, or is the 
  application of that research to comment on a primary or secondary source. </p>
  <p>Let it be stressed: <span class="highlight">the only primary source in a study 
  of computer software is the software</span>—not the product documentation, not 
  even the source code, just the software as actually executed by the computer.
  </p>
  <p>For more about the nature of this work and my reasons for doing it, please 
  read <a href="about/analysis.htm">Software Analysis by Reverse Engineering</a>.
  </p>
  <h2>Navigation </h2>
  <p>There are far too many pages at this website for you to navigate without the 
  expandable table of contents to the left of this page. If you see no such thing, 
  then please check the <a href="browsing/index.htm">Browsing Guide</a>. </p>
  <p>For an overall description of how these many pages are organised and of what 
  little I expect of you for reading them, see <a href="about/index.htm">About This 
  Site</a>. </p>
  <h2>Contact </h2>
  <p>To criticise me, thank me or submit a wish list, please read the page about
  <a href="feedback/index.htm">feedback</a>. I am especially concerned, of course, 
  to hear about errors which I need to correct. </p>
  <p>To ask for help with a technical problem, even one that I address at this site, 
  please <a href="consult/index.htm">consult</a> me formally and expect to pay for 
  my time. </p>
  <h2>Support </h2>
  <p>This website is funded from <a href="consult/what.htm">consultation services</a> 
  for Windows programming. If you appreciate the research behind the site and the 
  free publication of what I find time to write up, then please consult me for your 
  Windows programming. If you have nothing to consult me on, then please recommend 
  my consultation services as widely as possible. </p>
  <p>Better, if you would like to see the research and writing become established 
  as full-time work for the public good, then please recommend it to people (including 
  companies and universities) who have the resources to fund it and may also have 
  the will. If all you have is an idea for possible funding, it’s very possibly 
  more than occurs to me with my limited mind for these things, so please
  <a href="mailto:feedback@geoffchappell.com?subject=Suggestion%20for%20Funding">
  send me your suggestion</a>. </p>
