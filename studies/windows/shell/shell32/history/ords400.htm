<h1>SHELL32 4.0 Ordinal-Only Exports </h1>
<p>Version 4.0 has 210 distinct functions that are exported only by ordinal from 
one or other or both of the Windows and NT implementations. For many years, almost 
all were left undocumented. </p>
<p>A selection were documented some time after they were re-implemented in SHLWAPI.DLL. 
Many of these are still exported from SHELL32 but as small implementations that 
redirect to SHLWAPI or even as forwards to SHLWAPI (so that importing the SHELL32 
function actually imports from SHLWAPI). Microsoft documents these functions only 
as SHLWAPI functions, giving no hint of their earlier existence as SHELL32 functions.
</p>
<p>A larger selection were documented as
<a target="_top" href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms807073.aspx">Settlement 
Program Interfaces</a> in late 2002. These are almost all dated by Microsoft to 
version 5.0, and a few are said to require version 6.0. </p>
<p>Windows Vista began a programme of retiring obsolete functions. They continue 
to be exported from SHELL32 but only as forwards to SHUNIMPL.DLL, where they are 
failed. A few functions were discontinued in the first builds of version 6.0 but 
were then revived for Windows Vista just to retire them. </p>

<h2>Functions Previously Exported By Name </h2>
<p>A few functions would be listed above except that they are exported by name from 
two SHELL32 versions in the prehistory of 32-bit Windows. One of them continues 
to be exported by name, yet also with a reliable ordinal from version 4.0 onwards. 
Another may have been merely tentative in the early versions, before settling as 
an ordinal-only export until its documentation among the Settlement Program Interfaces. 
The last of them is never exported by name again, nor is it ever documented. </p>
