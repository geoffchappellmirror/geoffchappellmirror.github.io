  <h1>HviGetHardwareFeatures </h1>
  <p>The <span class="function">HviGetHardwareFeatures</span> function obtains the 
  output of a Microsoft-compatible hypervisor’s <span class="instruction">
  <a href="../../../../cpu/cpuid/index.htm">cpuid</a></span> lleaf 0x40000006.
  </p>
  <h2>Declaration </h2>
  <pre class="source">VOID HviGetHardwareFeatures (<a href="../../../inc/shared/hvgdk_mini/hv_hypervisor_hardware_features.htm">HV_HYPERVISOR_HARDWARE_FEATURES</a> *);</pre>
  <h3>Parameters </h3>
  <p>The one argument provides the address of a structure that is to receive the
  <span class="instruction">cpuid</span> output. </p>
  <h3>Platform </h3>
  <p>The <span class="macro">HV_HYPERVISOR_HARDWARE_FEATURES</span> in the declaration 
  is hypothesised as Microsoft’s macro that stands for an appropriate processor-specific 
  structure. For both the x86 (i386) and x64 (amd64) processors, this structure 
  is named <span class="struct">
  <a href="../../../inc/shared/hvgdk_mini/hv_x64_hypervisor_hardware_features.htm">
  HV_X64_HYPERVISOR_HARDWARE_FEATURES</a></span>. Microsoft is known to define an
  <span class="struct">HV_ARM64_HYPERVISOR_HARDWARE_FEATURES</span> structure when 
  building for other processors, but this lies (far) outside the scope of this website.
  </p>
  <h2>Availability </h2>
  <p>The <span class="function">HviGetHardwareFeatures</span> function is exported 
  by name from the kernel in version 10.0 and higher. </p>
  <h3>History </h3>
  <p>Public symbol files for the version 6.3 kernel name
  <span class="inline routine">HviGetHardwareFeatures</span> as an internal routine 
  that had as its one argument a pointer to what was then the
  <span class="struct">HV_HYPERVISOR_HARDWARE_FEATURES</span> structure, but the 
  binary shows no sign of anything like what version 10.0 has as the
  <span class="function">HviGetHardwareFeatures</span> function. Indeed, it has 
  no known use of <span class="instruction">cpuid</span> leaf 0x40000006. It is 
  here thought that <span class="inline routine">HviGetHardwareFeatures</span> and 
  at least one caller of it are defined in some header that was included by the 
  source file (<a href="../../../source/ntsym.htm">ntsym.c</a>) whose compilation 
  merges type information into the public symbol file, but then none of them are 
  called from any source file whose compilation contributes to the kernel. Thus 
  can <span class="inline routine">HviGetHardwareFeatures</span> be in the public 
  symbols without a trace of it in the binary. Though it is not seen in the version 
  6.3 kernel, it plainly did exist. That it’s the origin of the exported function 
  must be all but certain. </p>
  <h2>Documentation Status </h2>
  <p>The <span class="function">HviGetHardwareFeatures</span> function is not documented.
  </p>
  <h2>Behaviour </h2>
  <p>If a hypervisor is present and implements <span class="instruction">cpuid</span> 
  leaves at least to 0x40000006—see <span class="function">
  <a href="gethypervisorvendorandmaxfunction.htm">HviGetHypervisorVendorAndMaxFunction</a></span>—then 
  the function copies to the given address whatever <span class="instruction">cpuid</span> 
  leaf 0x40000006 produces in the <span class="register">eax</span>,
  <span class="register">ebx</span>, <span class="register">ecx</span> and
  <span class="register">edx</span> registers. </p>
  <p>Otherwise, the structure at the given address is zeroed. This, in effect, is 
  the function’s indication of failure. </p>
  <h3>Quirk </h3>
  <p>This function does not check <span class="instruction">cpuid</span> leaf 0x40000001 
  to establish that the hypervisor is Microsoft-compatible. </p>
