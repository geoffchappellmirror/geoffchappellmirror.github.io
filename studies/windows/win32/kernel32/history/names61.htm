<h1>Exports Added For KERNEL32 6.1 </h1>
<p>The table below lists all the functions that first appear as KERNEL32 exports 
in version 6.1, i.e., for Windows 7. </p>
<p>Very many of the KERNEL functions that are new to version 6.1 are previously 
known (and documented) as exports from ADVAPI32 or are new names for functions that 
are previously known (and documented) as exports from PSAPI. These other functions 
continue to be exported from their modules but are implemented only as stubs, to 
jump to the new implementations in KERNEL32. Discard these as a mere rearrangement, 
and Windows 7 does not add very much to the count of KERNEL32 functions. Of what 
remains, many are specific to x64 builds and many of the rest are undocumented.
</p>
<p>Several documented functions that were new for version 6.1 do not survive to 
the first service pack. Their replacements are documented correctly as requiring 
Windows 7 SP1. Yet even years later (the time of writing being 27th May 2012, they 
come with a curious note about the difficulty of using them since “there is no SDK 
for SP1.” </p>
<p>Undocumented functions are <span class="undocumented">highlighted yellow</span>. 
Among them are two functions, <span class="function">GetProcessUserModeExceptionPolicy</span> 
and <span class="function">SetUserModeExceptionPolicy</span>, which Microsoft presumably 
means to document but meanwhile leaves to an article about the hotfix that prompted 
their introduction:
<a target="_top" href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/976038">Exceptions that are 
thrown from an application that runs in a 64-bit version of Windows are ignored</a>. 
The hotfix precedes Windows 7 SP1 but neither function survives to Windows 8: were 
they intended as temporary all along? </p>
