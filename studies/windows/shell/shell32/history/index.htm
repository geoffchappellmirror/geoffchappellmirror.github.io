<h1>SHELL32 Versions </h1>
<p>The main shell module (SHELL32.DLL) has so far existed in nine variations 
considered by Microsoft to have sufficient external impact to deserve at least a 
difference in the minor version number. </p>

<p>No distribution with Windows, NT or Internet Explorer is shown for version 
1.30 because all copies inspected were found on disks for other products 
(specifically, for Win32s as redistributed with various packages for Windows 
programming). Versions 1.30 and 3.51 predate my experience with 32-bit user-mode 
Windows and have been included in this study mostly for curiosity. They also 
predate what has become for most users the essential look and feel of Windows, 
i.e., the taskbar and Start menu. Yet these versions are 32-bit executables, 
they are named SHELL32.DLL (in contrast to the 16-bit SHELL.DLL), and there is 
demonstrable continuity. </p>
<p>Version 5.50 is omitted from the presumably authoritative review of shell DLL 
versions that Microsoft presents on the page
<a target="_top" href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/bb776779.aspx">Shell 
and Common Controls Versions</a> in the MSDN Library. That page also says that 
“Version 5.0 of Shell32.dll will be distributed with … Windows Me”, and although 
it may be what was once planned, it is demonstrably not how the release turned 
out. </p>
<h2>Builds </h2>
<!--webbot bot="Include" u-include="../../_include/builds.htm" tag="BODY" startspan -->

<p>Though the next table fusses over such details as build numbers and dates, it 
is certainly not meant as a comprehensive list even of builds that had formal, public 
releases. For that, consult Microsoft, who manufacture the software and are surely 
best able of anyone to present a definitive record. Bear in mind, however, that 
if Microsoft’s published documentation could sensibly be relied on as either comprehensive 
or accurate, then you could not now be reading these notes. </p>
<p>Builds are arranged in increasing order of the file version as recorded in the 
executable’s resources. This version number is readily visible using Windows Explorer 
either in a so-called infotip for the file or by accessing the Version tab in the 
Properties dialog for the file. Programmers know this version number as coming from 
the so-called root block of the version-information resource, specifically from 
the <span class="member">dwFileVersionMS</span> and <span class="member">dwFileVersionLS</span> 
members of a <span class="struct">VS_FIXEDFILEINFO</span> structure. </p>
<p>The date stamp shown for each version is more obscure. File dates are easily 
modified after the executable is built and are anyway liable to be shown differently 
when read from different time zones. However, there is in each executable’s header 
a date stamp which is set when the executable is built and which is not commonly 
changed afterwards. It is readily accessible to anyone with programming knowledge 
and appropriate tools, e.g., Microsoft’s own DUMPBIN utility. </p>
