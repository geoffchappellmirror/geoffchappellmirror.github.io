<h1>URLSubstitution </h1>
<p>This function resolves various substitutable parameters in a URL. </p>
<h2>Declaration </h2>
<pre class="source">HRESULT 
URLSubstitution (
    LPCWSTR lpUrl, 
    LPWSTR lpBuffer, 
    DWORD cchBuffer, 
    DWORD dwFlags);</pre>
<p>The function has ANSI and Unicode forms, but not together in one version, and 
apparently not with an A or W suffix. The Unicode form is given above since the 
ANSI form is long obsolete. </p>
<h3>Parameters </h3>
<p>The <span class="argument">lpUrl</span> argument provides the address of a Unicode 
string to process. </p>
<p>The <span class="argument">lpBuffer</span> and <span class="argument">cchBuffer</span> 
arguments describe a buffer (by address and capacity in characters, respectively) 
that is to receive the processed string. </p>
<p>The <span class="argument">dwFlags</span> argument provides bit flags that specify 
the desired <a href="sub.htm">URL substitutions</a>. </p>
<h3>Return Value </h3>
<!--webbot bot="Include" U-Include="../_include/hresult.htm" TAG="BODY" startspan -->

<p>The function returns zero for success, else an error code. </p>

<!--webbot bot="Include" i-checksum="1551" endspan -->
<h2>Behaviour </h2>
<p>For each substitutable parameter that is enabled by the given
<span class="argument">dwFlags</span>, the function replaces that parameter’s first 
occurrence with an evaluation (including to replace with nothing, i.e., remove).
</p>
<p>The replacement is done in buffers on the stack, which allows that the output 
buffer may overlap the input. These buffers have capacity for
<span class="constant">INTERNET_MAX_URL_LENGTH</span> (0x0824) characters. Exceeding 
this capacity does not cause the function to fail. Instead, the function does what 
it can but with truncation, so that the results are perhaps better regarded as undefined 
(not that the function provides any formal indication that truncation has occurred).
</p>
<h2>Availability </h2>
<p>The <span class="function">URLSubstitution</span> function is exported from:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>SHDOCVW.DLL as ordinal 150 in versions 4.71 and 4.72; </li>
  <li>SHDOCVW.DLL as ordinal 165 in version 5.0 and higher; </li>
  <li>IEFRAME.DLL as ordinal 165 in version 7.0 and higher. </li>
</ul>
<p>Beware that as ordinal 150, the function operates on ANSI strings, not Unicode. 
With the change to Unicode for version 5.0, ordinal 150 is reused for the
<span class="function"><a href="../dochost/getstdlocation.htm">_GetStdLocation</a></span> 
function. </p>
<!--webbot bot="Include" U-Include="../_include/ieframe600.htm" TAG="BODY" startspan -->

<p>In version 6.0 from Windows Vista, and higher, SHDOCVW continues to export the 
function but only by forwarding to IEFRAME. </p>

<!--webbot bot="Include" U-Include="../_include/undoc471.htm" TAG="BODY" startspan -->

<p>Though this function dates from as long ago as 1997, it was still not 
documented by Microsoft as late as the January 2007 edition of the Windows Vista 
Software Development Kit (SDK). </p>

<h3>Unexported Implementations </h3>
<p>The transfer of <span class="function">URLSubstitution</span> from SHDOCVW to 
IEFRAME is not as clean as might be imagined. Although attempts to import the function 
from SHDOCVW are forwarded to IEFRAME, SHDOCVW retains an implementation for internal 
use (specifically, as a helper for the function <span class="function">
<a href="urlsubloadstring.htm">URLSubLoadString</a></span>, which SHDOCVW continues 
to export even though IEFRAME also has a copy which it doesn’t export). </p>
<p>Two more modules from Windows Vista, namely IEXPLORE.EXE and INETCPL.CPL, reproduce 
the coding from IEFRAME rather than import the function. Microsoft’s published symbol 
files confirm that all three acquire this code from the same source file via a library, 
named STOCK_IE.LIB, and strongly suggest that SHDOCVW’s implementation is from what 
may have been the original source file. </p>
<p>The URLMON.DLL from Windows Vista has yet another coding of this function, apparently 
from yet another source file. This implementation does not support as many parameters, 
only {SUB_OLCID} and {SUB_CLCID}, and has C++ linkage. It appears to have been copied 
from SHDOCVW, rather than imported, so that URLMON version 6.0 could, by editing 
or possibly by conditional compilation, avoid converting to and from Unicode when 
resolving substitutable parameters in an ANSI string. Yet for the version 6.0 from 
Windows Vista, and higher, this copy in URLMON is natively Unicode and would surely 
be just as well imported from IEFRAME. </p>
<p>One more implementation appears to have been copied from SHDOCVW even longer 
ago and to have been edited substantially (even to acquire an extra argument). It 
is in MSOE.DLL, i.e., the main component of Outlook Express, later named Windows 
Mail. </p>
