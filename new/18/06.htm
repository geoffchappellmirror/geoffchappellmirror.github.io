  <h1>New or Updated in June 2018 </h1>
  <p>My return in June to writing-up for free publication has produced work that’s 
  all over the place. There turn out to have been several reasons for the break 
  since <a href="../17/10.htm">November</a>. </p>
  <p>First, I need to earn an income. I keep bleating on about this, but if you 
  use my published material, quite possibly to help you with paid work, including 
  for employers who wouldn’t employ me, then it seems only fair to remind you that 
  I don’t draw a salary for it. </p>
  <p>Second, as I expected in November, the purchase of new computers side-lined 
  me into private research to help me get past my many frustrations with Windows 
  10. I count myself as an advanced user, yet I have never felt so helpless with 
  any computer as I did in November and December when trying to set up Windows 10 
  by myself from scratch. It’s not as if Windows has got more complex than I can 
  comprehend. It is instead that Windows now comes with a strong feeling that I 
  am not in charge of my own computers. Windows is now a “service” that comes with 
  Microsoft as the IT Department to the world. But what an
  <span class="emphasis">intrusive</span> IT Department! They threaten to reboot 
  my computer any time they judge that I’m not using it. They spontaneously change 
  my settings or rearrange my desktop icons, often as a surprise after one of those 
  reboots. Then, while I’m putting everything back, they interrupt me to tell me 
  that they’ve made things better! Who is it who writes such invasive, obstructive 
  software but tells us that it’s so much for our benefit that we have to accept 
  it? And who is it who designs such obviously poor user interfaces, e.g., for making 
  you work a little bit harder for every little thing, yet thinks they’re good? 
  That I don’t get it perhaps means that I am now “officially” an old man! </p>
  <p>Mostly though, the delay in writing up is because I got it into my head to 
  commit to an examination I had long put off as important but which would surely 
  need more effort that I can justfiy for my own interest. But then I got to see 
  Microsoft taking advantage of information asymmetry in some commercial support 
  that is not mine to talk about. The subject, however, is anyone’s to study. Though 
  it had always seemed too big to take on, I resolved that its time had come. I’m 
  no stranger to putting large amounts of my own time into one or another research 
  project, but never before have I done so with no idea how I might write any of 
  it up! I still don’t even know how I’ll fit it all into this website’s organisation. 
  But a few results will stand on their own and a first article is ready this month, 
  if only as a draft of a first pass. </p>
  <h2>Notes </h2>
  <p>That Windows has code for significant behaviour that Microsoft does not document 
  is nothing but inevitable. Sometimes, even often, Microsoft keeps to itself that 
  the behaviour exists or is possible. Every now and then, though, Microsoft goes 
  further and makes the code inaccessible to ordinary Windows users by putting it 
  behind a licensing barrier. </p>

  <h2>Kernel-Mode Windows </h2>
  <p>It was inevitable but as I worked my way through a succession of Windows 10 
  releases for the preceding write-up, I just had to look for how and when Microsoft 
  fixed the long-lived kernel bug that can crash Windows from user mode and which 
  I reported to Microsoft in late December 2016 and published here in
  <a href="../17/01.htm">January 2017</a> after concluding that Microsoft was insufficiently 
  responsive. (For my take on that, see <a href="../../hot/17/01.htm">Most Viewed 
  in January 2017</a>.) </p>
  <p>Surely not inevitable is that of the two simple coding errors that independently 
  can cause the same crash, the 1703 release of Windows 10 fixes only one. An immediate 
  consequence is that it remains true that all known versions of Windows can be 
  crashed by one small unprivileged user-mode program. Almost as immediate is that 
  I’ve had to update most of my own pages that describe not just the bug but the 
  relevant functionality (the study and documentation of which was, after all, how 
  the bug ever got found). </p>
  <p>Microsoft tells me that their second attempt is in an update scheduled for 
  July 2018. I do not expect that Microsoft will tell me where they describe the 
  problem. I do not expect that Microsoft will describe the problem so plainly that 
  I will be able to know where just from casual reading. As far as I’ve ever seen, 
  plain description doesn’t follow even when those who report a problem to Microsoft 
  go along hook, line and sinker with Microsoft’s scheme of Coordinated Disclosure, 
  whether for a bounty or for a few crumbs of acknowledgement. That “security research” 
  gives such cover to any software vendor is to everyone’s shame. </p>

  <h2>Shell </h2>
  <p>Tacked on, not quite as an after-thought, are two pages of user-mode cataloguing 
  that I prepared in February as background to fixing for myself what is for me 
  one of the bigger user-interface irritations of modern Windows. As noted in November 
  2017, there’s much such stuff to do before I can see myself using Windows 10 comfortably. 
  More will come. </p>
