  <h1>ETW_KERNEL_HEADER_EXTENSION </h1>
  <p>The <span class="struct">ETW_KERNEL_HEADER_EXTENSION</span> is event-specific 
  data for the <span class="constant">WMI_LOG_TYPE_HEADER_EXTENSION</span> (0x0005) 
  and <span class="constant">WMI_LOG_TYPE_GROUP_MASKS_END</span> (0x0020) events 
  as held in the trace buffers or flushed to an Event Trace Log (ETL) file for a 
  system-logging session, which typically means an NT Kernel Logger session. </p>
  <h2>Usage </h2>
  <p>The <span class="constant">WMI_LOG_TYPE_HEADER_EXTENSION</span> and
  <span class="constant">WMI_LOG_TYPE_GROUP_MASKS_END</span> events make a pair 
  for tracking what types of event get enabled and disabled for the session. They 
  show this by reporting the logger’s <span class="struct">
  <a href="../ntwmi/perfinfo_groupmask.htm">PERFINFO_GROUPMASK</a></span>. This 
  is an undocumented elaboration of the <span class="member">EnableFlags</span> 
  that are documented for the <span class="struct">EVENT_TRACE_PROPERTIES</span> 
  structure as input to the <span class="function">StartTrace</span> and
  <span class="function">ControlTrace</span> functions. </p>
  <p>In telling what types of event were initially enabled for the session, the
  <span class="struct">ETW_KERNEL_HEADER_EXTENSION</span> is arguably as important 
  a record of what to expect in an ETL file as is the <span class="struct">
  <a href="../../shared/evntrace/trace_logfile_header.htm">TRACE_LOGFILE_HEADER</a></span> 
  that is the event-specific data for the <span class="constant">WMI_LOG_TYPE_HEADER</span> 
  event that is the first even in every ETL file. For sessions that have the
  <span class="constant">EVENT_TRACE_SYSTEM_LOGGER_MODE</span> (0x02000000), the
  <span class="constant">WMI_LOG_TYPE_HEADER_EXTENSION</span> event is so important 
  that it is always the <span class="emphasis">second</span> event. As the session 
  continues, <span class="constant">WMI_LOG_TYPE_GROUP_MASKS_END</span> and
  <span class="constant">WMI_LOG_TYPE_HEADER_EXTENSION</span> events are logged 
  in pairs on each update of the session’s group masks, to report the old and new 
  masks, respectively. </p>
  <p>Data for a <span class="constant">WMI_LOG_TYPE_HEADER_EXTENSION</span> or
  <span class="constant">WMI_LOG_TYPE_GROUP_MASKS_END</span> event comprises:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>a <span class="struct">
    <a href="../ntwmi/traceheaders/system_trace_header.htm">SYSTEM_TRACE_HEADER</a></span>;
    </li>
    <li>the <span class="struct">ETW_KERNEL_HEADER_EXTENSION</span>. </li>
  </ul>
  <p>In the <span class="member">Marker</span> that begins the
  <span class="struct">SYSTEM_TRACE_HEADER</span>, the <span class="member">Flags</span> 
  are 0xC0, the <span class="member">HeaderType</span> is 0x01 or 0x02 for a 32-bit 
  or 64-bit trace session, respectively, and the <span class="member">Version</span> 
  is nowadays 0x02 but is 0x01 in traces written by Windows versions before 6.0. 
  The <span class="member">Size</span> is the total in bytes of both structures. 
  The <span class="member">HookId</span>, as the identifier of the event and thus 
  of how the event-specific data that follows is interpreted, is
  <span class="constant">WMI_LOG_TYPE_HEADER_EXTENSION</span> or
  <span class="constant">WMI_LOG_TYPE_GROUP_MASKS_END</span>. </p>
  <h2>Documentation Status </h2>
  <p>The <span class="struct">ETW_KERNEL_HEADER_EXTENSION</span> is not documented.
  </p>
  <!--webbot bot="Include" U-Include="_include/typeinfo_struct.htm" TAG="BODY" startspan -->

<p>A few public disclosures are known from Microsoft, though not as any sort of 
plain-English documentation. One is that a previously unpublished header named NTETW.H 
was published in the original and Version 1511 editions of the Windows Driver Kit 
(WDK) for Windows 10, and this header contains a C-language definition of the structure.
</p>
<p>Were it not for this limited and possibly unintended disclosure of NTETW.H, a 
practical equivalent of the C-language definition (but missing comments, of course) 
would anyway be known from type information in symbol files. But this too has the 
look of an oversight. Type information for this structure has never appeared in 
any public symbol files for the kernel or for the obvious low-level user-mode DLLs. 
It has instead slipped out in symbol files for a smattering of higher-level user-mode 
DLLs, starting with Windows 8. For these few, the readily available symbol files 
actually are private symbol files and show that the unpublished
<a href="../../../source/inc/ntetw.htm">NTETW.H</a> was included when compiling 
the corresponding binaries. </p>

<!--webbot bot="Include" endspan i-checksum="23935" -->
  <!--webbot bot="Include" U-Include="_include/clfsmgmt.htm" TAG="BODY" startspan -->

<p>Type information also has been published in a statically linked library, named 
CLFSMGMT.LIB, which Microsoft distributes with the Software Development Kit (SDK) 
starting for Windows Vista. This does not have the forensic quality as has type 
information in symbol files for the binaries that ship with an operating system, 
for although it is as accurate for when the library was built, there is no requirement 
that the library have been built with the operating system that it targets. There 
can be, and often is, some discrepancy, and there is anyway not always a fresh library 
for each service pack. </p>

  <h2>Layout </h2>
  <p>The <span class="struct">ETW_KERNEL_HEADER_EXTENSION</span> is nowadays 0x24 
  bytes in both 32-bit and 64-bit Windows, but it began as 0x20 bytes. Offsets, 
  types and names in the table that follows are from type information in symbol 
  files and libraries, and from the published C-language definition, as described 
  above. What’s known for versions that predate the known availability of type information 
  is from inspection of binaries. </p>
  <table class="Struct">
    <colgroup>
      <col class="Offset"><col class="Definition"><col class="Versions">
    </colgroup>
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>Offset </th>
        <th>Definition </th>
        <th>Versions </th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>0x00 </td>
        <td>
        <pre class="source">PERFINFO_GROUPMASK GroupMasks;</pre>
        </td>
        <td>5.2 and higher </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>0x20 </td>
        <td>
        <pre class="source">ULONG Version;</pre>
        </td>
        <td>6.0 and higher </td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
  <p>Taking the <span class="struct">ETW_KERNEL_HEADER_EXTENSION</span> as a persistent 
  description of a logging session that may have long ended, the
  <span class="member">GroupMasks</span> tells which types of event were enabled 
  for the session and the <span class="member">Version</span> records how advanced 
  is the kernel that logged the events. </p>
  <p>The <span class="member">Version</span> is observed to be the same as produced 
  in the <span class="member">EventTraceKernelVersion</span> member of the
  <span class="struct"><a href="event_trace_version_information.htm">EVENT_TRACE_VERSION_INFORMATION</a></span>.
