<h1>DWMCORE Versions </h1>
<p>DWMCORE.DLL was introduced for Windows 7, apparently from a reduction of MILCORE.DLL 
from Windows Vista: </p>
<table class="FileVersions">
  <colgroup>
    <col class="Version"><col class="Package">
  </colgroup>
  <tr>
    <th>File Version </th>
    <th>Distribution </th>

  </tr>
  </table>
<h2>Builds </h2>
<!--webbot bot="Include" U-Include="../../_include/builds.htm" TAG="BODY" startspan -->

<p>The following builds have been inspected for these notes. Most are from MSDN 
discs. Some, especially since Microsoft greatly reduced its shipment of operating 
systems on MSDN discs, are from service packs downloaded (typically as self-extracting 
executables) from a Microsoft website. </p>
<p>Builds are arranged in increasing order of the file version as recorded in the 
executable’s resources. This version number is readily visible using Windows Explorer 
either in a so-called infotip for the file or by accessing the Version tab in the 
Properties dialog for the file. Programmers know this version number as coming from 
the so-called root block of the version-information resource, specifically from 
the <span class="member">dwFileVersionMS</span> and <span class="member">dwFileVersionLS</span> 
members of a <span class="struct">VS_FIXEDFILEINFO</span> structure. </p>
<p>The date stamp shown for each version is more obscure. File dates are easily 
modified after the executable is built and are anyway liable to be shown differently 
when read from different time zones. However, there is in each executable’s header 
a date stamp which is set when the executable is built and which is not commonly 
changed afterwards. It is readily accessible to anyone with programming knowledge 
and appropriate tools, e.g., Microsoft’s own DUMPBIN utility. </p>
