<h1>ExIsResourceAcquiredSharedLite </h1>
<p>This function tests whether the current thread has acquired a given Executive 
Resource for either exclusive or shared access. </p>
<h2>Declaration </h2>
<pre class="source">ULONG ExIsResourceAcquiredSharedLite (ERESOURCE *Resource);</pre>
<p>in version 5.0 and higher, but </p>
<pre class="source">USHORT ExIsResourceAcquiredSharedLite (ERESOURCE *Resource);</pre>
<p>in versions 3.50 to 4.0 inclusive. </p>
<h3>Parameters </h3>
<p>The <span class="argument">Resource</span> argument is the address of the
<span class="struct"><a href="eresource.htm">ERESOURCE</a></span> to test. </p>
<h3>Return Value </h3>
<p>The function returns the current thread’s acquisition count. This is the number 
of times the thread would have to release the resource (without reacquiring it) 
before losing access. If the current thread does not have access to the resource, 
whether exclusive or shared, then the function returns zero. </p>
<h2>Availability </h2>
<p>The <span class="function">ExIsResourceAcquiredSharedLite</span> function is 
exported by name from the kernel in versions 3.50 and higher. </p>
<h2>Documentation Status </h2>
<p>The <span class="function">ExIsResourceAcquiredSharedLite</span> function has 
plausibly always been documented. Certainly it is documented as early as the Device 
Driver Kit (DDK) for Windows NT 3.51. (No DDK for Windows NT 3.50 is available for 
reference.) </p>
<p>Note, however, that although the function’s declaration in NTDDK.H was updated 
for the change of return type in version 5.0, the documentation was not updated 
for it until the Windows Driver Kit (WDK) for Windows Vista. Documentation since 
the WDK for Windows 7 would have it that the function is “Available in Windows 2000 
and later versions”. </p>
<h2>Behaviour </h2>
<p>The <span class="function">ExIsResourceAcquiredSharedLite</span> function examines 
the given resource’s <span class="struct">OWNER_ENTRY</span> table, including its 
one or two built-in entries, while holding the resource’s spin lock. If the current 
thread is in the table, the function returns the corresponding count, else it returns 
zero. </p>
<p>The table is for all owners, both shared and exclusive. To this function, exclusive 
ownership is a particular kind of shared ownership. </p>
<h3>Variations </h3>
<p>The count, as the <span class="member">OwnerCount</span> member in the
<span class="struct">OWNER_ENTRY</span> structure, was widened from
<span class="type">SHORT</span> to <span class="type">LONG</span> for version 5.0. 
It is not known why the count is signed in the structure but is returned by this 
function as unsigned. This difference was reconciled by a rearrangement of the structure 
for version 6.1, which reduced the count’s width in the structure to 30 bits while 
making it unsigned. </p>
<p>The <span class="member">ResourceIndex</span> in the <span class="struct">
<a href="../../../inc/ntos/ke/kthread/index.htm">KTHREAD</a></span>, which version 4.0 
introduced to provide for remembering where a thread’s <span class="struct">OWNER_ENTRY</span> 
is in the owner table of the last resource the thread acquired, is not used for 
this function until version 5.0. </p>
<p>Version 6.0 is the first to treat exclusive ownership not just incidentally as 
a particular kind of shared ownership but as a special case. </p>
<p>Single-processor builds do not acquire and release the resource’s spin lock, 
even in the usual sense of just raising the IRQL to <span class="constant">DISPATCH_LEVEL</span>: 
they instead disable and re-enable interrupts. </p>
<h3>IRQL </h3>
<p>The <span class="function">ExIsResourceAcquiredShared</span> function can be 
called at any IRQL up to and including <span class="constant">DISPATCH_LEVEL</span>. 
The <span class="argument">Resource</span> is assumed to be in non-paged memory.
