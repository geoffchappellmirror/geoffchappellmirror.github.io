  <h1>RSS Feed </h1>
  <p>Readers occasionally ask for notification that this website has new content, 
  in contrast to having to look from time to time for whether I have posted a new
  <a href="../new/index.htm">What’s New</a> page and then to remember whether the 
  latest that’s there is new to them. It’s a good suggestion, of course. </p>
  <p>Of the various technologies for this, the RSS feed is easily what’s suggested 
  most. No doubt RSS devotees expect that authors of websites will adapt the content 
  for presentation as an RSS feed. They likely also expect to read the new pages 
  without leaving their feed viewer. I’m sorry, but there’s only so much I can do. 
  I might do more if those who want my website as an RSS feed will tell me how to 
  set up what they want. </p>
  <p>What I will do is maintain an RSS feed’s XML database so that it lists each 
  new What’s New page and perhaps some others if they seem sufficiently self-contained. 
  This looks to me like the best balance. What I write here is not a sequence of 
  self-contained news items that’s naturally adapted to a feed. Neither is it a 
  blog of pages that are written once and then left alone. It is instead a large 
  collection of occasionally updated or reworked reference material that is organised 
  hierarchically with a Table Of Contents (TOC). The succession of What’s New pages 
  is the closest the site comes to being a blog. It’s all that I see is suitable 
  for presentation as a feed. </p>
  <p>As for presentation within a feed viewer, I’m sorry, but for better or worse, 
  I long ago decided that I do not want my content re-presented within other websites. 
  My scripts assume that my pages as I prepare them are loaded into a browser’s 
  top window. If instead they are already in a frame, then they try to get reloaded 
  into a new window. I don’t see why any feed viewer should have trouble with this. 
  Of course, I might think differently if I myself liked to see the Internet through 
  a feed viewer. </p>
  <p>Anyway, that’s how things are, and why, if only for now. Meanwhile, if you 
  want that your feed viewer subscribes to this site, then here’s the
  <a href="../rss.xml">RSS Feed XML</a> (which is anyway where some feed viewers 
  look for it automatically). </p>
