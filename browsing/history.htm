  <h1>A Brief History of This Site’s Browser Requirements </h1>
  <p>This website has existed only since January 2007. Only then did I finally get 
  round to realising that I ought to have a “proper” presence on the World Wide 
  Web. There was an old site from ten years earlier, but it was all in “my” directory 
  at an Internet Service Provider, without even its own domain name. It was never 
  intended as more than a loose collection of occasional writing to help promote 
  my <a href="../consult/index.htm">consultation services</a>. Even then, it lay 
  dormant for nearly five years until revived in 2004 for a research project that 
  I tried to write-up-as-you-go-along. After another such project a couple of years 
  later, the old site had grown to a thousand pages. (For the record, the old site 
  was accessible as www.ozemail.com.au/~geoffch until its discontinuation in April 
  2011.) </p>
  <p>Formal help for my readers to find their way around all that material at the 
  old site had always seemed well beyond my means. After all, I am not an “HTML 
  author” or “web designer” and haven’t any more interest in becoming one than I 
  have in becoming an expert at the macro language of any word processor. The best 
  it seemed I could do was to place at the top and bottom of every page a chain 
  of up-links through the site’s directory tree. </p>
  <p>That truly was unreasonable of me. I myself dislike intensely those many websites 
  that exist to present reference material yet constrain their readers to follow 
  links from page to page with no overview easily to hand. The whole point to reference 
  material, at least in a subject that is rich in interesting content, is that readers 
  may connect information in ways that the author thought unlikely, or even in ways 
  that simply never would have occurred to the author. It just does not make sense 
  to me that the links on each page of a large collection can be the sole guide 
  to that page’s relationship with other pages. </p>
  <p>Unsurprisingly then, I have gone to the other extreme and removed all navigational 
  support from all document pages. Of course, where the text of a document touches 
  on something that is described in greater detail on another page, there is a link 
  in place. Such links are surely the essence of the web. But those clumsy chains 
  of up-links are gone, as are any other links that looked like inventions of necessity. 
  Instead, I provide you with what I think are easy means to see what’s here—indeed, 
  to take in just how much is here. A dynamic table of contents (TOC) lets you take 
  in my arrangement of the site while concentrating on whatever bits of it interest 
  you. </p>
  <p>Much to my surprise in 2007, it turned out that a satisfactory table of contents 
  is far from trivial for a web site. The difficulties are perhaps why navigational 
  support for large websites of complex technical material tends to be extraordiinarily 
  poor. Even the giant corporations of the industry show nothing to be proud of 
  on this point, and most of them get this poor outcome at the price of expecting 
  us to let them keep cookies—or, worse, execute their code—on our computers. I 
  have sought from the start to refrain from all such imposition, but there are 
  limits to what can be achieved with just the basics of HTML, CSS and JavaScript. 
  Though the old site was very near to being completely dumb, this new site does 
  have technical expectations for <a href="index.htm">browsing the site</a>. </p>
  <p>In designing for a TOC I had three essential requirements. First, for a TOC 
  to count as usable, it must allow that multiple branches can be open simultaneously, 
  it must always show where you are in the possibly very large tree that you have 
  opened, and it must preserve your selection of branches as you browse from page 
  to page. Second, this must all be done without saving anything, e.g., cookies, 
  on your computer or running anything more demanding than JavaScript and only then 
  to script the Document Object Model (DOM). Finally, both for you if you choose 
  not to run my scripts and for me when I write the content, the document pages 
  must be independent of the TOC. </p>
  <p>That each document page and each TOC (and a banner, too) can be viewed independently 
  and be written independently fitted naturally into an original implementation 
  with FRAMESET and FRAME. As much as documentation of HTML 5 may say that frames 
  are obsolete, they might better be described as discontinued. Not all the functionality 
  of frames can be reproduced straightforwardly with DIV and fixed positioning. 
  Really, there should be a rule for standards committees: if you say some functionality 
  is obsolete, then it’s your duty to show how the functionality is superseded. 
  When I designed this website’s user interface in 2007, it certainly was not reasonable 
  to disregard users of Internet Explorer 6 (which had no support for fixed positioning) 
  and so I wrote the user interface with frames. For a reworking in 2011, I persisted 
  with the frames. </p>
  <p>As of February 2021, the frames are gone in favour of DIV and IFRAME. To get 
  anywhere near to reproducing the behaviour of a FRAME, the DIV must have fixed 
  positioning. This is the website’s first requirement that goes beyond what browsers 
  have supported as quirks mode, which I have long taken as some lowest common denominator 
  to conform to. My thinking, rightly or wrongly, is that quirks mode ended up as 
  the distillation of many years of experience by countless people before standards 
  were settled on and is arguably known more definitely than are all the sometimes 
  very different interpretations that various browsers have of the supposedly definite 
  standards. </p>
  <p>Use of IFRAME is natural for the desired independence, but the independence 
  perhaps does not need to be absolute and it’s only inevitable that use of IFRAME 
  will go away too. But I do not look forward to that! I have actual work to do!
