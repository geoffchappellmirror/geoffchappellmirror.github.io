  <h1>KEVENT_PAIR </h1>
  <p>Though obscure now—indeed, for decades—the event pair was once vital to the 
  efficiency of windowing and other functionality in the Win32 subsystem. The
  <span class="struct">KEVENT_PAIR</span> structure (formally
  <span class="struct">_KEVENT_PAIR</span>) is the kernel’s internal packaging of 
  a pair of events to operate as one object. It is in turn exposed through the Object 
  Manager as an <span class="struct">EEVENT_PAIR</span> such that event pairs can 
  be created, opened and otherwise worked with though handles. </p>
  <p>Two user-mode threads—you might call them client and server—create or open 
  a pair of synchronisation events as one object by calling the NTDLL functions
  <span class="function">NtCreateEventPair</span> and <span class="function">NtOpenEventPair</span>. 
  The two events—call them low and high—each represent one thread’s work. When one 
  thread completes work for the other, it signals its own of the events and waits 
  on the other’s. They each do this as one call to the kernel, passing one handle 
  to the NTDLL functions <span class="function">NtSetLowWaitHighEventPair</span> 
  and <span class="function">NtSetHighWaitLowEventPair</span>. </p>
  <p>In version 5.0 and higher, once this operation gets to the kernel and the handles 
  are resolved to objects, the kernel actually does just call
  <span class="function">KeSetEvent</span> for one event and
  <span class="function">KeWaitForSingleObject</span> for the other. Earlier versions, 
  however, look for efficiency from the certainty that setting the event is just 
  the first operation in a pair. They even give each thread a built-in event pair 
  which a client and server can operate through the NTDLL functions
  <span class="function">NtSetLowWaitHighThread</span> and
  <span class="function">NtSetHighWaitLowThread</span> without the overhead of interpreting 
  a handle. The original Windows versions apparently regarded this as so important 
  that these functions get to the kernel through their own interrupt numbers (0x2B 
  and 0x2C), thus shaving away even the small overhead of having the kernel look 
  up its service table. </p>
  <p>All this special attention to synchronising with event pairs was arguably nothing 
  but dim prehistory even before Windows 8.1 reduced all the relevant functions 
  to trivial failure. For one vestige that remains to this day, see NTSTATUS.H where 
  comments for <span class="constant">STATUS_NO_EVENT_PAIR</span> talk of a “thread 
  specific client/server event pair object”. </p>
  <h2>Documentation Status </h2>
  <p>Neither the <span class="struct">KEVENT_PAIR</span> nor any of the relevant 
  NTDLL functions were ever documented. No C-language definition is known to have 
  been published in any header from a Device Driver Kit (DDK) or Windows Driver 
  Kit (WDK) or any other of Microsoft’s programming kits. For no Windows version 
  is the structure even known from type information in public symbol files for the 
  kernel or NTDLL. </p>
  <p>The first that <span class="struct">KEVENT_PAIR</span> is known as Microsoft’s 
  name for the structure is from output of the <span class="command">
  <a href="../../../../debug/kdex2x86/strct.htm">!strct</a></span> command as implemented 
  by the KDEX2X86 debugging extension which Microsoft supplied with the Device Driver 
  Kit (DDK) for Windows NT 4.0. This also provides offsets and names (but not types) 
  of the members. </p>
  <p>Type information, such as might be found in public symbols, has instead been 
  published in a statically linked library named CLFSMGMT.LIB which Microsoft supplies 
  with the Software Development Kit (SDK) for user-mode programming. The x86 build 
  of this library has type information for versions 6.0 to 6.2 inclusive, the x64 
  build for version 6.2 only. These libraries for version 6.2 place the definition 
  in an otherwise unpublished header named <a href="../../../source/inc/ke.htm">
  ke.h</a> (at line 488) from which it is thought to have been deleted for version 
  6.3. </p>
  <h2>Layout </h2>
  <p>The <span class="struct">KEVENT_PAIR</span> is 0x24 and 0x38 bytes in 32-bit 
  and 64-bit Windows, respectively, in all versions that have it. </p>
