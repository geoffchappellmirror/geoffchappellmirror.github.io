  <h1>The CryptoAPI and Windows 95 </h1>
  <p>Although the <a href="index.htm">CryptoAPI</a> first appeared in Windows 95 
  OEM Service Release 2 (OSR2) and was at least initially described by Microsoft 
  as requiring OSR2, it seems there is nothing to prevent the CryptoAPI from being 
  back-fitted to the original Windows 95 release simply by installing an updated 
  ADVAPI32 (which is where the interface layer is implemented) and one or more standard 
  CSPs. Microsoft often devises improvements of an operating system after the original 
  release and makes them available as service packs, updates, add-ons or whatever, 
  typically as a free download. </p>
  <p>It does indeed turn out that Microsoft supports the CryptoAPI as an enhancement 
  of the original Windows 95. Curiously though, it seems that the only method Microsoft 
  presents for installing this improvement of Windows 95 is to install Internet 
  Explorer 3.02 or higher. </p>
  <p>This is just one of countless examples of Internet Explorer—which at least 
  started as an application marketed in competition with others that do similar 
  work—being used by Microsoft as a <span class="emphasis">de facto</span> Windows 
  95 Service Pack. Since at least early 1997, customers of Microsoft’s most widely 
  used operating system have typically had their access to improvements of that 
  operating system depend on their also becoming users of Microsoft’s web browser.
