<h1>Restricted Callers </h1>
<p>Some kernel-mode functions that can be called from user mode are sensitive in 
that output they produce may contain kernel-mode addresses. Though this can happen 
accidentally, the typical case has a deliberateness to it in that the function exists 
to deliver information to user-mode processes that in turn exist for diagnostics 
and instrumentation. But relatively few user-mode processes have that purpose, none 
should be trusted more than can’t be avoided, and some are intentionally up to no 
good. </p>
<p>Revealing a kernel-mode address to a malicious user-mode caller is arguably not 
itself a security vulnerability, or not much of one, but it is useful armoury for 
an attacker because it may be the key to successfully exploiting some other vulnerability. 
To limit this, version 6.3 of the Windows kernel introduces the notion of a
<span class="definition">restricted caller</span> that is not to be given kernel-mode 
addresses, nor even information from which to infer kernel-mode addresses. </p>
<p>Specially affected among <a href="../../../../win32/ntdll/api/native.htm">native 
API functions</a> is <span class="function"><a href="sysinfo/query.htm">NtQuerySystemInformation</a></span>. 
Some of its many information classes are made to fail for restricted callers. Others 
are permitted for restricted callers but with kernel-mode addresses omitted from 
whatever information is returned. A more subtle example is that
<span class="function"><a href="profile/create.htm">NtCreateProfile</a></span> and
<span class="function"><a href="profile/createex.htm">NtCreateProfileEx</a></span> 
are failed for restricted callers who ask to profile kernel-mode execution. </p>
<p>What counts as a restricted caller depends on the Windows version. Originally, 
a restricted caller is specifically a low-integrity process. In detail, a process 
has low integrity if an integrity level cannot be obtained for the process’s primary 
token or if the integrity level is less than
<span class="constant" title="constant">SECURITY_MANDATORY_MEDIUM_RID</span> (0x2000). 
Windows 10 has a wider restriction that is essentially the same as implemented for 
the <span class="function" title="function">RtlIsSandboxedToken</span> function: 
a user-mode caller is restricted unless it can pass an access check for
<span class="constant">READ_CONTROL</span> rights to securable objects that have 
medium integrity. </p>
