  <h1>Opportunity from 2020 </h1>
  <p>Massed withdrawal from ordinary social activity early in 2020 surely was necessary 
  as an emergency measure to get the coronavirus pandemic under control, but staying 
  for days on end in my apartment mutated from weeks or months into a year. At least 
  I do have the luxury of being able to keep to myself for long times, both financially 
  and psychologically. In all my imagining of how I might be cast in a movie apocalypse, 
  I figured I’d be killed off early as an example of being not fit to survive, but 
  what we got instead is this one scenario that I’m very well adapted for. All I 
  wish is that I had realised from the start that it would go on for so long: I 
  might have planned my time better! </p>
  <p>For make no mistake: provided the pandemic (or its embarrassingly poor handling 
  by most rich-world governments) has not turned your life into a question of survival, 
  it made 2020 into a year of opportunity. Because <span class="emphasis">everyone’s</span> 
  life was turned upside down in 2020, there never will be so little awkwardness 
  about having nothing to show for a year. If you had the luxury of not starving, 
  then 2020 was <span class="emphasis">the</span> year to risk whatever it is that 
  has been on your to-do list for years even though you’ve known all along that 
  you never would find the many months needed just for getting it started. Write 
  that novel or play! </p>
  <p>This website drew two opportunities from 2020. </p>
  <h2>Presentation </h2>
  <p>One opportunity is a <span class="highlight">thorough revision of the site’s 
  scripts and stylesheets</span>, even to the extent that I may no longer be able 
  to say straightforwardly that I am not any sort of web programmer. Except for 
  a week of slightly desperate revision in 2011, these scripts and stylesheets had 
  barely changed since a token effort in 2009 at cross-browser compatibility. Now 
  they are getting a bigger reworking than was involved in writing them back in 
  2007. </p>
  <p>Back then, Internet Explorer 7 was still overwhelmingly the most widely used 
  browser and the burning desire of most web programmers not just to dethrone it 
  but to be rid of it was only just beginning to look powerful enough to succeed. 
  Who knew, though some did, but web designers’ insistence on standards which mostly 
  rejected Internet Explorer’s existing (and in some cases long-established) methods 
  turned the tables so that Internet Explorer, with its need for compatibility with 
  old behaviour, didn’t adapt to the standards any better than web programmers had 
  been able to keep making special cases for Internet Explorer. </p>
  <p>Browsers have moved on, mostly for the better. This website will never be one 
  that chases the latest fads—not least because it doesn’t have ads or other third-party 
  content—but it certainly could look better on new standards-compliant browsers. 
  Indeed, there has been a need for this for many years. There are plenty of new 
  stylings that have graceful fallbacks for old browsers, such that I have no excuse 
  not to use them where they help. There are also old stylings that Internet Explorer 
  supported but which either were contrary to the standards at the time or became 
  so as the standards evolved. Curiously many of these have no easy or satisfactory 
  replacement. On some points the standards have arguably not benefited anyone and 
  it may even be fair to say they are ridiculously deficient (as with the styling 
  of columns in tables). </p>
  <p>Users has moved on, too. I detect a dichotomy. For computers on (or beneath) 
  desktops, monitors have got really big and users often have dozens and even hundreds 
  of pages open as tabs in a maximised browser that’s 2000 or more pixels wide. 
  Nobody resizes the browser window to fit one page’s ideal presentation at, say, 
  half this. Yet lines of text across the maximised width become unreadably long. 
  More than a few readers have pointed this out to me in recent years. Most 
  noted kindly 
  that this is to be expected of old-school websites. Still, something had 
  to be done sooner or later. </p>
  <p>At the other extreme are the many who try to read with a full-screen browser 
  on a mobile phone. Some phones have screens that aren’t even 400 pixels wide. 
  There’s only so much I can do about the presentation of long and deeply technical 
  material to fit so narrow a screen. Some data just is not sensibly read this way. 
  But although such data is present on most of the thousands of pages here, some 
  pages have none of it, as with introductions and most in the Home section of the 
  site. Again, something had to be done sooner or later. </p>
  <p>At both extremes, push eventually turned to shove because of my first explorations 
  of the other opportunity. </p>
  <h2>Reverse Engineering </h2>
  <p>Much more interesting to an author, and I hope to you too, is some reorganisation 
  of content to open some larger themes. Though this website does not teach reverse 
  engineering, nor even is about reverse engineering, it plainly has reverse engineering 
  as more than mere background. The pandemic has been my opportunity to bring reverse 
  engineering to the centre. My chosen theme is: <span class="highlight">what can 
  reverse engineering tell us about Microsoft’s source code for Windows?</span>
  </p>
  <p>Certainly someone must do something along this line. Too many people, not just 
  employees of Microsoft, take as granted that any detailed examination of Windows 
  needs access to source code—and that an attempted reproduction of or substitute 
  for Windows, as with the ReactOS project, must have used Microsoft’s source code 
  by hook or by crook. And why should they not think so? Where the reverse engineering 
  of Windows doesn’t look like it has benefited from insider knowledge, it has instead 
  the look of having been lifted from the back of a truck. Some writing on Windows 
  internals somehow picks up both looks—concurrently, even—and the writers are widely 
  regarded as brilliant reverse engineers. They may actually be brilliant, but I 
  think they’ve done incalculable damage to the development of reverse engineering 
  as any sort of academic discipline within computer science, let alone to its respectability. 
  If what I achieve with this website is at all worthwhile, it will be that I’ve 
  done as best as one man can to counteract this damage. </p>
