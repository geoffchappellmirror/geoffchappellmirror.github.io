<h1>The Microsoft Visual C++ Compiler </h1>
<p>The Microsoft Visual C++ suite includes a program named CL.EXE that provides 
the command-line interface for a process that takes a C or C++ source file as input 
to produce an object file as output. This process is called compilation and although 
CL.EXE does not do very much of the actual work itself, it is common to call CL 
the compiler. </p>
<p>CL can also arrange what is typically the next process, in which object files 
are given to a linker as input to produce an executable as output. However, linking 
can be, and even typically is, done separately. Though these notes on the compiler 
do (or will) address CL’s execution of the linker, the
<a href="../link/index.htm">Microsoft Visual C++ Linker</a> is otherwise regarded 
as independent, with a separate set of notes. </p>
<h2>Reference Versions </h2>
<p>The particular Visual C++ product studied for these notes is the one in which 
the CL.EXE program has the version number 13.00.9466. Information about implementation 
details and (especially, one might hope) coding errors may be highly specific to 
that version. Where documentation or official literature is mentioned, the reference 
version is that which is supplied with the product, unless otherwise noted. No plans 
exist to track future versions, of either the software or the documentation. Teams 
of programmers at Microsoft can write this stuff much faster than I can study it—and 
they also have the advantage of making money from the time they put into it, not 
that this necessarily means they take much care to keep their documentation accurate 
with respect to the product. </p>
