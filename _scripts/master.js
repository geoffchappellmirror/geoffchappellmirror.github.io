    the DEFER attribute! 

    Historically, this script was also the first even in non-document pages, 
    notably the one BANNER.HTM and the several TOC.HTM. The different pages 
    each loaded MASTER.JS but followed with different other scripts. The 
    point to MASTER.JS was that it provided whatever is common to all types 
    of page. 

    Since 2021, the only non-document page that ever loads MASTER.JS is the 
    long-retired VIEWER.HTM and only then for the very particular reason 
    that its VIEWER.JS replaces DOCUMENT.JS for just this one page.  */

/*  This site presents documents with a banner and a Table of Contents (TOC) 
    without needing that the documents themselves be prepared with any 
    knowledge of their re-presentation beyond loading this script and 
    DOCUMENT.JS and the corresponding stylesheets. 

    Do not neglect the preceding paragraph! It is very important, both for 
    the author's preparation of content and so that every page presents 
    acceptably even for readers who disable scripts. 

    When a document page is loaded directly, its DOCUMENT.JS constructs a 
    viewer for the document's original body. Long ago, this viewer was 
    written as FRAMESET and FRAME tags in the HTML of VIEWER.HTM. Later, a 
    slightly redesigned frameset got built by scripts. Since 2021, it is 
    reinterpreted as DIV and IFRAME elements built by scripts. 

    Ideally, MASTER.JS has no knowledge of the viewer but it is affected 
    indirectly because its functions and variables exist to be accessible 
    from other scripts but the means of access depends on whether those 
    scripts run in a document or non-document page. 

    Document pages load MASTER.JS and DOCUMENT.JS, necessarily, and may load 
    more. All these scripts run - straightforwardly - in the browser context 
    that the document was loaded into. To them, the object named window, 
    with a lower-case w, is always and necessarily this browser context. 
    Some functions defined in MASTER.JS take Window, with an upper-case W, 
    as an argument. This window can be either the document's own browsing 
    context or that of a non-document page in the viewer. 

    The banner and TOC pages - collectively the non-document pages - load 
    BANNER.JS and TOC.JS, respectively. They too may load more scripts. In 
    the expected circumstances, these pages are loaded into an IFRAME and 
    their scripts run in the nested browser context. To them, the object 
    named window is the browser context of their IFRAME. They have access to 
    MASTER.JS through their window object's top window.  */

    and so that they do not pollute the window object, define them as 
    properties of a Config object. This is a rough simulation of a C++ 
    namespace, though without the flexibility of the using statement. 

    That modern JavaScript has a "const" keyword which meets the goal 
    confirms the wider desirability - but it's something of a hack, notably 
    for introducing that typeof can throw, and there's no obvious way to use 
    it for new browsers without making syntax errors for old browsers. 

    TO DO:

    These scripts' increasingly many global functions arguably pollute the 
    window object even more than do the variables. Perhaps the better 
    argument is for doing nothing about either. After all, these scripts 
    will never co-exist with anyone else's. Still, as a low priority, think 
    about namespaces for the functions too.  */

    correct TOC to show for a document page depends on absolute pathnames. 
    It breaks if the host's copy of this site is deeper into the host's 
    directory tree than at any real site (whether live on the Internet or 
    just on an intranet for testing or for my private use). 

    This is particularly a problem with copies made by browsers to save a 
    page and by search engines to serve as if cached, but it's also seen 
    when pages are reproduced whole to be read at someone else's website. 
    Why anyone does this rather than link to the original, I don't know, but 
    I can't help notice that such reproduction often has no acknowledgement 
    or at least not a prominent acknowlegement. Saving and caching might be 
    cared about, but other reproduction too often looks like theft. 

    I don't see it as properly my burden to accommodate any of this. Without 
    the assurance of being run at a recognised host, no scripts run 
    non-trivially. 

    A hostname (such as read from a location object) counts as recognised if 
    it either is the canonical domain or contains the canonical domain as a 
    subdomain. If we take as granted that the hostname is a period-separated 
    sequence of one or more subdomains, then it's recognised if the

    argument but instead gets its Event object from the window object.

    just as much single-threaded but perhaps recognises that it needn't be 
    and anticipates that it won't always be. It has the handler receive its 
    Event object as an argument. 

    The two models also give their handlers different "this" references. The 
    standard plumbs for the target. Internet Explorer had it - naturally, 
    and even correctly for functions at global scope, but less usefully - as 
    the window. 

    In the scheme below, callers supply a Handler that fits the standard 
    for an event listener. This handler can assume that Event is available

    even for version 11 the implementation is demonstrably problematic, most 
    obviously for not having the replace method, and less obviously for not 
    interpreting the classList as having no empty or duplicated members. 

    Even when the classList is properly implemented, its utility is lessened 
    for being tied to an element. It's not immediately helpful for working 
    with just a string such as might be (but is not yet) some element's 
    className. 

    The TokenList object defined below is intended as something like the 
    DOMTokenList but for an arbitrary string of space-separated tokens 
    independent of any DOM element. 

    If the browser's JavaScript implementation has a built-in Set object, 
    then some of the TokenList has a straightforward implementation: add, 
    remove and contains from the DOMTokenList map cleanly to the Set's add, 
    delete and has. Some is less straightforward - and the standard anyway 
    was thoughtless to use "delete" for naming a method. Is it worth the
