<h2>Builds </h2>
<!--webbot bot="Include" U-Include="../../_include/builds.htm" TAG="BODY" startspan -->

<p>Though the next table fusses over such details as build numbers and dates, it 
is certainly not meant as a comprehensive list even of builds that had formal, public 
releases. For that, consult Microsoft, who manufacture the software and are surely 
best able of anyone to present a definitive record. Bear in mind, however, that 
if Microsoft’s published documentation could sensibly be relied on as either comprehensive 
or accurate, then you could not now be reading these notes. </p>
<p>Builds are arranged in increasing order of the file version as recorded in the 
executable’s resources. This version number is readily visible using Windows Explorer 
either in a so-called infotip for the file or by accessing the Version tab in the 
Properties dialog for the file. Programmers know this version number as coming from 
the so-called root block of the version-information resource, specifically from 
the <span class="member">dwFileVersionMS</span> and <span class="member">dwFileVersionLS</span> 
members of a <span class="struct">VS_FIXEDFILEINFO</span> structure. </p>
<p>The date stamp shown for each version is more obscure. File dates are easily 
modified after the executable is built and are anyway liable to be shown differently 
when read from different time zones. However, there is in each executable’s header 
a date stamp which is set when the executable is built and is not commonly changed 
afterwards. It is readily accessible to anyone with programming knowledge and appropriate 
tools, e.g., Microsoft’s own DUMPBIN utility. </p>

<!--webbot bot="Include" U-Include="../../_include/iesmalldiff.htm" TAG="BODY" startspan -->

<p>In the days when Microsoft had two operating systems named Windows, most Internet 
Explorer versions supplied the executable separately for Windows and NT (and in 
some cases with a further separation for NT 4.0 and Windows 2000). Where two date 
stamps are presented on the same row for an Internet Explorer release, it means 
that the Windows and NT executables differ only in the file header’s date stamp 
and checksum (and that the date stamps are from the same day). </p>
