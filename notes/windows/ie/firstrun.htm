  <h1>The First Run Page in Internet Explorer </h1>
  <p>Probably all web browsers have a home page or start page. This is the page 
  that the browser is to display whenever it is started without being given an address 
  to go to. Some users may like to start their browsing always from a particular 
  page on the Internet, perhaps at a search engine or portal. Others may figure 
  that since they’re going to type in a URL for the page that they actually do want 
  to see, they don’t want to muck around with some other page first. It is pretty 
  important, then, that the home page be configurable. It may even be something 
  that users care about quite a lot. Some measure of this is that the Internet Properties 
  dialog has configuration of the home page as its very first item. </p>
  <p>The home page is also something that computer manufacturers have cared about 
  quite a lot. They have perhaps no better way to contact you as a new customer 
  than to configure the pre-installed Windows so that your first use of Internet 
  Explorer takes you to their website, where you can register your purchase, give 
  them your address, etc. </p>
  <p>Internet Explorer has long provided for this separate configuration of a home 
  page for ordinary use and a first home page for the very first use. </p>
  <h2>Problem </h2>
  <p>Recent versions of Internet Explorer, particularly as supplied with Windows 
  Vista, may not immediately respect the user’s choice of home page or even the 
  manufacturer’s configuration of a first home page. Instead, Internet Explorer 
  insists on connecting to the Internet and going to a Microsoft website. The Internet 
  Explorer from Windows Vista would send you to one of the following: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=76277 </li>
    <li>http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=74005 </li>
    <li>http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=59527 </li>
  </ul>
  <p>What’s more, this diversion is “sticky”. Unlike the first home page, you can’t 
  just dismiss it the once and never be troubled by it again. Instead, this diversion 
  to Microsoft continues at every startup of Internet Explorer until Microsoft’s 
  page has been loaded and its scripts have been allowed to run. Even then, the 
  diversion will recur from time to time until you have not only let the page load 
  and let its scripts run but have answered its questions to Microsoft’s satisfaction.
  </p>
  <p>You may have specified a home page in the Internet Options, even before running 
  Internet Explorer. You may intend, if only for a while, just to browse files on 
  your local computer or your secure intranet. Perhaps your computer doesn’t even 
  have an Internet connection. (Yes, such machines do exist!) Yet you will find 
  that Internet Explorer tries every time to take you first to a Microsoft website 
  on the Internet. True, you can stop the page from loading and you don’t have to 
  answer Microsoft’s questions. You can just click the home button and get to your 
  chosen home page, but how tiresome and silly is that? </p>
  <p>How can you tell Internet Explorer to go directly to your home page, without 
  the side-trip to Microsoft’s website? </p>
  <h2>Solution </h2>
  <p>Knowledge of Internet Explorer’s algorithm for choosing a home page produces 
  the following as the plausible methods for disabling this diversion to Microsoft’s 
  website: </p>
  <ol>
    <li>set 1 as the DWORD of data for the registry value <span class="regvalue">
    DisableFirstRunCustomize</span>; </li>
    <li>set 1 as the DWORD of data for both the registry values
    <span class="regvalue">RunOnceHasShown</span> and <span class="regvalue">RunOnceComplete</span>;
    </li>
    <li>put “go.microsoft.com” into a security zone, e.g., Restricted Sites, in 
    which running scripts is disabled. </li>
  </ol>
  <p>Details of the algorithm are presented separately, in an attempt at documenting 
  the otherwise undocumented function <span class="function">
  <a href="../../../studies/windows/ie/shdocvw/api/dochost/getstdlocation.htm">_GetStdLocation</a></span>. 
  Details of the relevant registry values are given later in this note. </p>
  <p>The first of the suggested methods is the ideal solution in one sense, because 
  it models your likely attitude. If you would like Internet Explorer not even to 
  think of showing the First Run page, then setting <span class="regvalue">DisableFirstRunCustomize</span> 
  to 1 tells Internet Explorer exactly what you want. On the down side is that this 
  registry value is explicitly subject to administrative whim. If an administrator 
  has set it differently in a higher-priority key than you are permitted to edit, 
  then this method is entirely ineffective. That said, if you are an administrator 
  who wants to banish the First Run page for yourself or on behalf of those in your 
  care, then this solution may be the most convenient because Microsoft actually 
  provides a user-interface tool. </p>
  <p>The second method has the merit of being available to all users, at least in 
  standard configurations of registry security. It works by convincing Internet 
  Explorer that the First Run page has loaded successfully and has been satisfactorily 
  completed so that it need not be shown again, even though it has in fact never 
  been shown at all. However, it has the detraction (for some) that you will have 
  to edit the registry. </p>
  <p>The third method does not require any tool more sophisticated than the Internet 
  Options in the Control Panel, but it may be frustrated by an administrator having 
  withdrawn permission to assign sites to zones. It works because Internet Explorer 
  knows the First Run page depends on scripting, such that showing it would be at 
  best pointless if scripting is prohibited. Internet Explorer then sets the
  <span class="regvalue">RunOnceHasShown</span> and <span class="regvalue">RunOnceComplete</span> 
  values to record that it should never again try showing the page. In Windows Vista 
  and higher, that’s the end of it. Unfortunately, if your operating system is earlier 
  than Windows Vista, Internet Explorer will proceed with trying to show the page 
  once, but the diversion will never be attempted again. </p>
  <p>Note that the benefit of the third method is obtained forever by running Internet 
  Explorer once while go.microsoft.com is in a zone with no scripting. The relevant 
  setting on the Security tab is called “Active scripting” and you must set it to 
  Disable. Setting to Prompt and answering No to the prompts is not enough. Scripts 
  are disabled by default in the Restricted Sites zone. You can move go.microsoft.com 
  to the Restricted Sites zone or you can disable scripting in the Internet zone. 
  Whichever you choose, you only have to keep this configuration for one run. If 
  you move go.microsoft.com to the Restricted Sites zone but think the site is too 
  useful to keep relegated, then just remove it from this zone once Internet Explorer 
  starts. Mind you, surely the main reason that a Restricted Sites zone exists is 
  to defend against sites that hijack the browser: go.microsoft.com is a model candidate.
  </p>
  <h3>Registry Details </h3>
  <p>The <span class="regvalue">DisableFirstRunCustomize</span> value may be in 
  any of the following four keys, given in order of decreasing precedence: </p>
  <table class="Registry">
    <tr>
      <td>Key: </td>
      <td><span class="regkey">HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Internet 
      Explorer\Main</span> <br>
      <span class="regkey">HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Internet 
      Explorer\Main</span> <br>
      <span class="regkey">HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\Main</span>
      <br>
      <span class="regkey">HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\Main</span>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Value: </td>
      <td><span class="regvalue">DisableFirstRunCustomize</span> </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Type: </td>
      <td><span class="constant">REG_DWORD</span> </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Data: </td>
      <td>0 to show the First Run page; <br>
      1 to show the First Home Page or Start Page; <br>
      2 to show the Welcome to Internet Explorer page </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Default: </td>
      <td>0 </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  <p>The merit in allowing multiple locations lies in the combination of applicability 
  and access. A setting in either of the <span class="regkey">HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE</span> 
  branches applies to all users, but the same setting in either of the
  <span class="keyword">HKEY_CURRENT_USER</span> branches is meant just for the 
  current user. A setting that is stored in a <span class="regkey">Software\Policies</span> 
  branch or in <span class="regkey">HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE</span> typically cannot be 
  modified except with administrative privilege. Note the reversal of machine and 
  user branches when <span class="regkey">Policies</span> is not involved. The first 
  key, as shown above, sets a machine-wide policy, with no per-user exceptions. 
  Even users who have write access to their own <span class="regkey">Policies</span> 
  branch cannot override a machine-wide policy. The last key also applies machine-wide, 
  but to supply preferences which users are free to override. </p>
  <p>In the first two of the keys listed above, the <span class="regvalue">DisableFirstRunCustomize</span> 
  value has user-interface support through the Group Policy Object Editor, as “Prevent 
  performance of First Run Customize settings” in the administrative template for 
  Internet Explorer (shown under Windows Components). </p>
  <p>The <span class="regvalue">RunOnceComplete</span> and
  <span class="regvalue">RunOnceHasShown</span> values may each be in either of 
  two keys, again listed in order of decreasing precedence: </p>
  <table class="Registry">
    <tr>
      <td>Key: </td>
      <td><span class="regkey">HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\Main</span>
      <br>
      <span class="regkey">HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\Main</span>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Value: </td>
      <td><span class="regvalue">RunOnceComplete</span> <br>
      <span class="regvalue">RunOnceHasShown</span> </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Type: </td>
      <td><span class="constant">REG_DWORD</span> </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Default: </td>
      <td>0 </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  <p>Internet Explorer accepts these values in a variety of types and sizes that 
  evaluate as boolean. However, <span class="constant">REG_DWORD</span> is surely 
  to be preferred. If nothing else, it is the type that Internet Explorer chooses 
  when setting the values. </p>
