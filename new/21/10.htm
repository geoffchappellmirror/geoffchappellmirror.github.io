  <h1>New in October 2021 </h1>
  <p>Whatever I may have meant—and really do mean still—through the pandemic year 
  about bigger themes of respectability in reverse engineering through improved 
  citation practices and in computer security by avoiding short cuts that would 
  ordinarily be thought unsatisfactory, I must now face that I have put them onto 
  the back burner for a while. </p>
  <p>Instead, I have let the relative freedom from attending daily to commercial 
  work, combined with wandering thoughts of what I’ve done for a career, become 
  an excuse for looking fairly intently at some of my earliest work. What might
  <span class="citation">DOS Internals</span> have been if written with the resources 
  of later life instead of those of a post-graduate student! The answer, it turns 
  out, is: not much different. Now I have dozens of pages and fragments of new writing 
  on DOS, but few that are even nearing completion and none that yet fit together 
  as a coherent body of work. </p>
  <p>There are serious points to this too, of course. I have quite taken fright 
  at how the most readily accessible history of DOS, notably on Wikipedia, has for 
  decades been in the hands of writers who see it only through the prism of other 
  operating systems. Some of this comes naturally enough from DOS’s vastly superior 
  replacements indulging DOS for compatibility. But much too much is written because 
  what survives as active interest in DOS is a hobbyist enthusiasm for open-source 
  projects that have developed from DOS’s lesser competitors and imitators. It’s 
  a little as if I’ve woken after decades to find that Wikipedia’s pages on milk, 
  cheese and dairy farming got written by fans of almond milk. </p>
  <p>Curiously, I also feel that time has stood still. In 1990 when I first got 
  online and even for the first few years in regular exchanges with the published 
  experts I was honestly surprised that most of what had been learnt about DOS was 
  done by observation and experiment, at best with using a debugger to step through 
  code and perhaps unassemble fragments, but not so much by an organised plan of 
  disassembling the whole code to study it as an exercise in logical deduction. 
  Yet now in 2021 I find otherwise well-written, careful studies that talk of discovering 
  an old program’s behaviour by having done extensive testing. Guys, the program’s 
  not even 1KB—yes, kilobyte! </p>
  <p>A larger point to such musing is that MS-DOS, including its extensions to support 
  networking and its elaborations to support multi-tasking, was plausibly near the 
  limit of what can be understood well by one expert programmer or even of what 
  can be discussed authoritatively by a group of such experts. Recurringly as I’ve 
  read through transcripts of depositions and even of court proceedings for anti-trust 
  cases involving DOS and especially of Windows, I’ve been overwhelmed by the sense 
  that this was never a process that had any chance of finding facts—even of what 
  lawyers call facts—let alone of establishing firm enough ground for deciding questions 
  of justice. It’s not as if software is getting less complex. At what stage must 
  we face that justice is beyond the courts’ capability? As we contemplate another 
  round of anti-trust investigations, would it not be more honest to admit that 
  whatever may be the fairness that’s aimed for, it’s less a question of law than 
  of policy? </p>
