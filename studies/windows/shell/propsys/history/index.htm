<h1>PROPSYS Versions </h1>
<p>The Property System library (PROPSYS.DLL) has so far existed in two variations 
considered by Microsoft to have sufficient external impact to deserve at least a 
difference in the minor version number. </p>
<table class="FileVersions">
  <colgroup>
    <col class="FileVersion"><col span="1" class="Package">
  </colgroup>
  <tr>
    <th class="FileVersion">PROPSYS Version </th>
    <th class="Distribution">Distribution </th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>6.0 </td>
    <td>Windows Vista (original and SP1) <br>Windows Server 2008 </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>7.0 </td>
    <td>Windows Vista SP2 <br>Windows 7 </td>

<p>That the major version increased for Windows Vista SP2 may not have been intended. 
Most notably, there is no change of exported functionality from the previous service 
pack. Nonetheless, the major version does change for this service-pack release, 
both in the executable’s own resources and for its installation as an assembly in 
the WinSxS directory. </p>
<h2>Builds </h2>
<!--webbot bot="Include" U-Include="../../_include/builds.htm" TAG="BODY" startspan -->

<p>Though the next table fusses over such details as build numbers and dates, it 
is certainly not meant as a comprehensive list even of builds that had formal, public 
releases. For that, consult Microsoft, who manufacture the software and are surely 
best able of anyone to present a definitive record. Bear in mind, however, that 
if Microsoft’s published documentation could sensibly be relied on as either comprehensive 
or accurate, then you could not now be reading these notes. </p>
<p>Builds are arranged in increasing order of the file version as recorded in the 
executable’s resources. This version number is readily visible using Windows Explorer 
either in a so-called infotip for the file or by accessing the Version tab in the 
Properties dialog for the file. Programmers know this version number as coming from 
the so-called root block of the version-information resource, specifically from 
the <span class="member">dwFileVersionMS</span> and <span class="member">dwFileVersionLS</span> 
members of a <span class="struct">VS_FIXEDFILEINFO</span> structure. </p>
<p>The date stamp shown for each version is more obscure. File dates are easily 
modified after the executable is built and are anyway liable to be shown differently 
when read from different time zones. However, there is in each executable’s header 
a date stamp which is set when the executable is built and which is not commonly 
changed afterwards. It is readily accessible to anyone with programming knowledge 
and appropriate tools, e.g., Microsoft’s own DUMPBIN utility. </p>
