<h1>THRDESKHEAD </h1>
<p>The <span class="struct">THRDESKHEAD</span> structure is the header for user 
objects that can be owned by a thread and are specific to a desktop. It begins the
<span class="struct">HOOK</span>, <span class="struct">IMC</span> and
<span class="struct"><a href="wnd/index.htm">WND</a></span> structures. </p>
<h2>Documentation Status </h2>
<p>The <span class="struct">THRDESKHEAD</span> is not documented. Type information 
for the structure is present in the public symbol files for WIN32K.SYS from Windows 
7—but not before and not since. </p>
<h2>Layout </h2>
<p>In the absence of definitive detail from Microsoft, even the introduction of 
the <span class="struct">THRDESKHEAD</span> cannot be dated with certainty. It is 
here dated from version 5.0, but it is version 4.0 that first has the (ancient) 
WIN32K routine that allocates handles for user objects and finds memory for them 
provide for a <span class="struct">DESKTOP</span> pointer at a common offset in 
all types of object. This first provision, however, is a base such that subsequent 
members differentiate whether the object is owned by a process or a thread. In version 
5.0 and higher, this differentiation is established first: </p>
<table>
  <colgroup>
    <col class="Offset" span="2"><col class="Definition">
  </colgroup>
  <tr>
    <th>Offset (x86) </th>
    <th>Offset (x64) </th>
    <th>Definition </th>
    <th>Versions </th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>0x00 </td>
    <td>0x00 </td>
    <td>
    <pre class="source"><a href="throbjhead.htm">THROBJHEAD</a>;</pre>
    </td>
    <td>5.0 and higher </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>0x0C </td>
    <td>0x18 </td>
    <td>
    <pre class="source">DESKTOP *rpdesk;</pre>
    </td>
    <td>5.0 and higher </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>0x10 </td>
    <td>0x20 </td>
    <td>
    <pre class="source">BYTE *pSelf;</pre>
    </td>
    <td>5.0 and higher </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>See that because the <span class="struct"><a href="procobjhead.htm">PROCOBJHEAD</a></span> 
and <span class="struct">THROBJHEAD</span> have the same size and alignment,
<span class="member">rpdesk</span> and <span class="member">pSelf</span> have the 
same offsets in both the <span class="struct"><a href="procdeskhead.htm">PROCDESKHEAD</a></span> 
and <span class="struct">THRDESKHEAD</span>, with the benefit of allowing that both 
structures can have these members set by the same code. </p>
<!--webbot bot="Include" U-Include="_include/pself.htm" TAG="BODY" startspan -->

<p>See also that <span class="member">rpdesk</span> and <span class="member">pSelf</span> 
are kernel-mode addresses. The <span class="struct">DESKTOP</span> that is pointed 
to from the object’s <span class="member">rpdesk</span> is not visible in user mode, 
but the object itself is visible in user mode in all processes that share the desktop. 
Of course, the object may—indeed, typically will—have a different user-mode address 
in each such process. So too may structures that are pointed to from the object. 
All such pointers hold kernel-mode addresses too. By themselves they are equally 
meaningless to user-mode code in all processes. The key to interpreting them is 
that <span class="member">pSelf</span> is a kernel-mode address of the object itself. 
Each process has its user-mode address for the object. Their difference can then 
be applied to other kernel-mode addresses (of anything in the same view) to convert 
them to user-mode addresses for that process. </p>
