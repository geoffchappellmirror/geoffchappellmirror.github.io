  <h1>WORKING_SET_TYPE </h1>
  <p>Windows has since ancient times had different types of something named a Working 
  Set which helps with efficient management of virtual address space. The Working 
  Set that is known best to programmers is the one that is maintained for each process. 
  It’s modelled by an <span class="struct"><a href="mmsupport.htm">MMSUPPORT</a></span> 
  structure that is embedded in the process’s <span class="struct">
  <a href="eprocess/index.htm">EPROCESS</a></span> as its <span class="member">Vm</span> 
  member. But even version 3.10 has a separate Working Set for the system cache: 
  its <span class="struct">MMSUPPORT</span> is an internal kernel variable named
  <span class="internal variable">MmSystemCacheWs</span>. Distinguishing this particular
  <span class="struct">MMSUPPORT</span> from any for a process was easy enough just 
  from its having a known address (in the kernel). </p>
  <p>Complications began with Windows 2000 and its introduction of sessions. Each 
  session has its own Working Set, also modelled by an <span class="struct">MMSUPPORT</span> 
  but now embedded in the session’s <span class="struct">MM_SESSION_SPACE</span> 
  (again as its <span class="member">Vm</span> member). So that kernel code can 
  quickly distinguish whether an <span class="struct">MMSUPPORT</span> is for a 
  process or a session, the <span class="struct">MMSUPPORT</span> was given a bit 
  flag named <span class="member">SessionSpace</span>. Opportunity was taken to 
  organise this and some other boolean properties into the <span class="struct">
  <a href="mmsupport_flags.htm">MMSUPPORT_FLAGS</a></span> structure, which has 
  since acquired many more defined bits, including by absorbing old members of the
  <span class="struct">MMSUPPORT</span>. </p>
  <p>When Windows 7 added two more Working Sets as internal variables—<span class="internal variable">MmPagedPoolWs</span> 
  and <span class="internal variable">MmSystemPtesWs</span>—the time perhaps had 
  come for a formal enumeration of these Working Sets as different types. Thus did 
  the <span class="struct">MMSUPPORT_FLAGS</span> gain a 3-bit
  <span class="member">WorkingSetType</span> member. Its values are drawn from the
  <span class="enum">WORKING_SET_TYPE</span> enumeration (formally
  <span class="enum">_WORKING_SET_TYPE</span>). </p>
  <p>Microsoft’s names for the enumeration and its defined values are all known 
  from public symbol files for the applicable versions: </p>
