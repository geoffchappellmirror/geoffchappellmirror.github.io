<h1>HTML Dialog Functions </h1>
<p>There was a time when writing a program’s user interface meant writing actual 
program code. The basic controls and their positioning on menus or in dialog boxes 
might be prepared using graphical design tools with no program code in sight. They 
would then be specified in the executable’s resources and could easily enough be 
loaded into view by a single Windows API call to a function (or macro) such as
<span class="function">DialogBox</span> or <span class="function">CreateDialog</span>. 
So far, so simple, but there can be a lot of program code required to support the 
dialog box through its interaction with the user and then to interpret whatever 
the user has done. Moreover, this program code is highly specific to the Windows 
API, particularly because it has the form of a dialog box procedure receiving window 
messages. </p>
<p>Those days are not yet passed, but increasingly many user interfaces are laid 
out as HTML pages whose own script does much of the run-time management and interpretation. 
This is apparently a benefit to everybody, including the manufacturers of the ever-faster 
computer hardware that is needed if the obvious bloat is not to be obvious visually.
</p>
<p>MSHTML exports several functions that display an HTML page as a user-interface 
feature such as a property sheet or dialog box: </p>
<ul>
  <li><span class="function"><a href="createhtmlpropertypage.htm">CreateHTMLPropertyPage</a></span>
  </li>
  <li><span class="function"><a href="showhtmldialog.htm">ShowHTMLDialog</a></span>
  </li>
  <li><span class="function"><a href="showhtmldialogex.htm">ShowHTMLDialogEx</a></span>
  </li>
  <li><span class="function">ShowModalDialog</span> </li>
  <li><span class="function"><a href="showmodelesshtmldialog.htm">ShowModelessHTMLDialog</a></span>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>These are all documented (excusing omission of <span class="function">ShowModalDialog</span> 
since it is in effect just an alias of <span class="function">ShowHTMLDialog</span>). 
However, the Windows SDK goes out of its way to make the functions awkward to use, 
giving directions such as “you must dynamically load the DLL and call this function 
by using the <span class="function">LoadLibrary</span> and
<span class="function">GetProcAddress</span> functions.” The reason is just that 
the Windows SDK doesn’t have an import library for MSHTML functions. You could write 
your own, of course. Or Microsoft could save everyone some trouble, including its 
own documentation writers, by publishing the import library that Microsoft already 
has. Where Microsoft’s own IEFRAME.DLL imports three of these HTML Dialog functions, 
it does the job the easy, natural way, because it has the advantage of being linked 
with an import library, MSHTMLP.LIB, that Microsoft does not supply with the Windows 
SDK. </p>
