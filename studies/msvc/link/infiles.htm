<h1>LINK.EXE Input Files </h1>
<p>Except if a directive begins with a hyphen or forward slash, or with an @ if 
on the actual command line, it names one or more input files. </p>
<h2>Wildcard Expansion </h2>
<p>The way for one directive to name more than one file is with wildcards. A 
directive that contains a ? or * expands, in effect, to a single-file directive 
for each file that exists with a pathname that matches the wildcard expression 
as given. </p>
<h2>Single-File Directives </h2>
<p>Where a directive, whether as given or implied by wildcard expansion, is 
intended to name one input file, some provisions exist for inferring a different 
name from what is specified. </p>
<h3>Default Extension </h3>
<p>LINK infers “.obj” as the file extension for any input file whose name does 
not already have an extension. This is for LINK only, not DUMPBIN, EDITBIN or 
LIB. The extension is inferred even if a file exists with the name as given, 
i.e., without the extension. Once the extension is inferred, the name is treated 
as if it had this extension all along. </p>
<h3>Search Paths </h3>
<p>If the input file does not exist as given, but is given with no drive or 
path, it may be sought elsewhere. </p>
<p>The main source of paths to search is the <span class="env">LIB</span> 
environment variable, whose value (like the well-known <span class="env">PATH</span> 
environment variable) is expected to provide one or more paths separated with 
semicolons.
</p>
<p>LINK and LIB, but not DUMPBIN or EDITBIN, first search for the file on the 
paths given in successive <span class="switch">/libpath</span> options. The 
order of
<span class="switch">/libpath</span> options with respect to the input-file 
directive is irrelevant. LINK and LIB make a first pass through all command-line 
directives to find <span class="switch">/libpath</span> options so that they are 
all known, wherever they are, by the time that a second pass discovers the 
input-file directives.
</p>
<p>Once an input file is found on a search path, the name is treated as if it 
had this path all along. </p>
