<h1>LIB /WX </h1>
<p>This option directs LIB to treat warnings as errors. </p>
<!--webbot bot="Include" U-Include="../../_include/wx-syntax.htm" TAG="BODY" startspan -->

<h2>Syntax </h2>
<p>No arguments are permitted. The switch is <span class="switch">/wx</span> only.
</p>

<!--webbot bot="Include" i-checksum="32848" endspan -->
<!--webbot bot="Include" U-Include="../../_include/wx-behaviour.htm" TAG="BODY" startspan -->

<h2>Behaviour </h2>
<p>The general effect of this option is to arrange that occurrence of a warning 
is itself an error (LNK1218). Should a warning occur, the corresponding warning 
message is followed by the error message and by termination. The warning number 
becomes the exit code. </p>
<h3>Exceptions </h3>
<p>The <span class="switch">/wx</span> option is irrelevant for warnings that have 
been successfully registered to be ignored (as done with the
<span class="switch">/ignore</span> option). If such a warning occurs while
<span class="switch">/wx</span> is active, then there is no warning message, no 
error message and no termination. </p>
<p>Warning LNK4224 is a hard-coded exception. It warns against using an option that 
has become obsolete. The intention seems to be that this warning is important enough 
that it must be seen and <span class="switch">/ignore</span> therefore does not 
disable it. Yet it is not so severe that <span class="switch">/wx</span> should 
make an error of it. If warning LNK4224 occurs while <span class="switch">/wx</span> 
is active, then there is a warning message, but no error message and no termination.
</p>

<h2>Comment </h2>
<p>For who knows what reason, this obviously convenient switch is apparently undocumented. 
A corresponding switch for the compiler, also <span class="switch">/WX</span> (necessarily 
in upper case), has long been documented. Microsoft even recommends that “for a 
new project, it may be best to use <span class="switch">/WX</span> in all compilations; 
resolving all warnings will ensure the fewest possible hard-to-find code defects.” 
Surely this argument would retain at least some merit when applied to linking?
</p>
<p>Though the <span class="switch">/wx</span> switch may be undocumented, Microsoft 
does use it in the master makefile for the Windows DDK. Indeed, the switch is active 
by default, being skipped only if the user knows to define the macro
<span class="macro">BUILD_ALLOW_LINKER_WARNINGS</span> (which the DDK documentation 
does not list among the Build Utility Macros). </p>
