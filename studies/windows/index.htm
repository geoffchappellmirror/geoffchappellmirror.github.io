  <h1>Windows </h1>
  <p>Microsoft Windows must be the largest, most sophisticated operating system 
  ever written. At its height of success—no, dominance—Windows was installed onto 
  all but a few percent of the computers that it was designed to run on. Even now, 
  talk of its being no longer dominant is less a story of being dethroned by competing 
  operating systems for computers than of a great broadening of what technologists 
  count as a computer. </p>
  <p>This website’s interest is in software that runs on computers that derive from 
  the IBM Personal Computer. These are the computers that the mass market in computing 
  was built on. Whether as personal computers or servers, these are still the overwhelming 
  bulk of electronic devices that consumers actually do think of as computers.
  </p>
  <h2>What is a Computer? </h2>
  <p>The day is perhaps not far off that my fridge will be a computer. Perhaps yours 
  already is. Most cars, tractors and even jet engines already are. Above all, most 
  mobile phones are. From a historical perspective, they are rather powerful computers. 
  it has long been a cliché that we now carry in our pockets and bags a vastly more 
  sophisticated computer than took man to the moon. (Well, you do: I don’t have 
  one.) </p>
  <p>But do ordinary people really think of their phones as computers? Are any of 
  these devices any more of a computer than is my 25-year-old hi-fi component that 
  has a central processor, hard disk and other peripheral devices, a file system, 
  an operating system with a primitive user interface, and even a serial port through 
  which to update the program that executes from ROM? We might as well say that 
  a Jacquard loom from the early 19th century was a computer—which in some very 
  real sense it was. In another sense, the term computer is nowadays applied so 
  widely that it risks being meaningless. </p>
  <p>I tend to think that what makes a computer a computer is the generality of 
  programs it will execute. At one extreme is a machine that has the typical components 
  of a computer but is limited to executing just one program that can only be changed 
  by the manufacturer as a firmware update. That’s my old (and much valued) hi-fi 
  component and may be your fridge or tractor. Technologists may count such a device 
  as a computer, especially if it connects to the Internet, but few of its actual 
  users would think of it as a computer. There’s not enough generality to its purpose.
  </p>
  <p>At the other extreme is a machine that runs an operating system that in turn 
  lets its owner load yet more programs. The owner might write such programs. More 
  likely, the owner obtains programs from software manufacturers. The more that 
  the programs can be arbitrary (subject only to technical requirements of the machine 
  and operating system), the more general is the device’s purpose, and the more 
  widely will the device be perceived more as a computer than as a phone or fridge.
  </p>
  <p>The fortune of Microsoft was built on Windows (and MS-DOS before it) as an 
  operating system for general-purpose computers to execute a generality of other 
  people’s software. Mass-market computing was built on this too. Microsoft is too 
  often not given enough credit for this. An open architecture for the hardware 
  was the gift of IBM, but Microsoft matched this with a progression of operating 
  systems whose support for arbitrary other software was both very general and remarkably 
  stable. That you can realistically be surprised if 64-bit Windows 10 in 2021 doesn’t 
  run a 32-bit Windows program that was written for Windows NT 3.1 in 1993, nearly 
  thirty years ago, is no small achievement from Microsoft’s sustained attention 
  to backwards compatibility. </p>
