<h1>Internal error during SetupPhase </h1>
<p>The <span class="command">link /help</span> command should display a brief description 
of how to get help on running the linker’s various sub-programs: </p>
<pre class="output">LINK /Link for help on Linker
LINK /Lib for help on Library Manager
LINK /Dump for help on Dumper
LINK /Edit for help on Editor
LINK /Help for help on Helper</pre>
<h2>Problem </h2>
<p>In the LINK.EXE version inspected for this report, namely 7.00.9466, the
<span class="command">link /help</span> command faults. The error message is </p>
<pre class="output">LINK : fatal error LNK1000: Internal error during SetupPhase </pre>
<p>followed by a dump of exception codes and CPU context. </p>
<p>The <span class="command">link /help</span> command may be undocumented and is 
anyway far from important, but it must count as some wonder that nobody at Microsoft 
bothered to run this simple command some time and report the embarrassing outcome.
</p>
<h2>Cause </h2>
<p>The cause of the problem will be familiar to many C programmers: a function in 
the <span class="function">printf</span> family is called with arguments that mismatch 
the format specifiers. In a function that is plausibly called something like
<span class="function">HelperMain</span> in Microsoft’s source files, each line 
of text is produced with code similar to </p>
<pre class="source">wprintf (L&quot;%S /%.*s for help on %S\n&quot;, szLink, cchSwitch, szProgram);</pre>
<p>where <span class="placeholder">szLink</span> is the upper-case file-name portion 
of whatever name LINK.EXE had when run, <span class="placeholder">szProgram</span> 
is the title of a sub-program such as “Linker” or “Library Manager” and
<span class="placeholder">cchSwitch</span> is the number of characters to take from 
the start of this title for use as the corresponding command-line switch. Compare 
the expectations of the format control string with the arguments that are actually 
given to the function: </p>
<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Expected Argument </th>
    <th>Actual Argument </th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>a string of single-byte characters </td>
    <td>a string of single-byte characters </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>a count of characters </td>
    <td>a count of characters </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>a string of wide characters </td>
    <td>a string of single-byte characters </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>a string of single-byte characters </td>
    <td>no argument </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>While the wide-character function is given string arguments that all use single-byte 
characters, all the type specifiers ought to use an upper-case S. While three string 
arguments are expected, three ought be given. Both defects would be remedied with 
code such as </p>
<pre class="source">wprintf (L&quot;%S /%.*S for help on %S\n&quot;, szLink, cchSwitch, szProgram, szProgram);</pre>
<h2>Applicable Versions </h2>
<p>The bug is seen in version 7.00.9466 from Microsoft Visual Studio 2002. It is 
not intended here to determine when the bug was introduced or to track when Microsoft 
fixes it. </p>
<p>That said, a quick inspection of an old version tells something of how the bug 
came to exist. In version 3.00.5270 (from Visual C++ 4.0), which does not have the 
fault, the corresponding code is </p>
<pre class="source">printf (&quot;%s /%.*s for help on %s\n&quot;, szLink, cchSwitch, szProgram, szProgram);</pre>
<p>Someone at Microsoft evidently tried to port this code to call a wide-character 
function in the style of <span class="function">wprintf</span> while keeping the 
single-byte strings. The natural port is the remedy proposed above, viz., of changing 
the %s specifiers to %S. Yet somehow, Microsoft converted only two of the three 
%s specifiers and lost one argument from the function call. </p>
<p>This problem is not seen for LINK.EXE version 8.00.50727.42 from Microsoft Visual 
Studio 2005. </p>
