<h1>SHRestrictionLookup </h1>
<p>This function gets the value of a shell <a href="index.htm">restriction</a> 
given by its ID within a table of supported restrictions. </p>
<h2>Declaration </h2>
<pre class="source">DWORD
SHRestrictionLookup (
    DWORD dwRestrictionId,
    LPCWSTR lpKey,
    const struct RESTRICTION_ITEM *lpRestrictionItems,
    LPDWORD lpRestrictionItemValues);</pre>
<p>Since the <span class="struct">RESTRICTION_ITEM</span> structure appears to 
be used only for this function, its format is as well given here. (The names for 
this structure and for its members are invented, no record of Microsoft’s names 
being yet known.) </p>
<pre class="source">struct RESTRICTION_ITEM {
    DWORD dwRestrictionId;
    LPCWSTR lpSubKey;
    LPCWSTR lpValue;
};</pre>
<h3>Parameters </h3>
<p>The <span class="argument">dwRestrictionId</span> argument identifies which 
restriction to look up. </p>
<p>The <span class="argument">lpKey</span> argument provides a null-terminated 
string that names a registry key, to be interpreted relative to <span class="regkey">
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE</span> 
or <span class="regkey">HKEY_CURRENT_USER</span>. This argument may be NULL to 
stand for <span class="regkey">Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies</span>.
</p>
<p>The <span class="argument">lpRestrictionItems</span> argument provides the 
address of an array of structures that describe the supported restrictions. A 
structure whose <span class="member">lpSubKey</span> member is NULL is treated 
as terminating the array and as not describing a restriction. </p>
<p>The <span class="argument">lpRestrictionItemValues</span> argument provides 
the address of an array of values for the supported restrictions, in the order 
set by the descriptive array. This array of values acts as a cache. A value of 
0xFFFFFFFF is treated as invalid, as if it has not yet been looked up. </p>
<h3>Return Value </h3>
<p>The function returns the value of the given restriction, else zero. </p>
<h2>Behaviour </h2>
<p>The <span class="argument">dwRestrictionId</span> argument is meaningful only 
if it matches a <span class="member">dwRestrictionId</span> member of some 
structure in the array at <span class="argument">lpRestrictionItems</span>. The 
value of the restriction is then the DWORD of data for the registry value named 
by
<span class="member">lpValue</span> in the subkey named by <span class="member">
lpSubKey</span> in the key named by <span class="argument">lpKey</span> in the
<span class="regkey">HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE</span> branch of the registry, else in 
the
<span class="regkey">HKEY_CURRENT_USER</span> branch. </p>
<p>If <span class="argument">dwRestrictionId</span> does not match a
<span class="member">dwRestrictionId</span> member of some structure in the 
array at <span class="argument">lpRestrictionItems</span>, the function returns 
zero. If the corresponding entry in the <span class="argument">
lpRestrictionItemValues</span> 
array is not 0xFFFFFFFF, it is accepted as the value of the restriction, without 
needing to query the registry. If the registry must be queried, then whatever 
value the function gets (including zero if the query fails), the function caches 
it in the <span class="argument">lpRestrictionItemValues</span> array. </p>
<h2>Availability </h2>
<p>The <span class="function">SHRestrictionLookup</span> function is exported 
from SHLWAPI as ordinal 266 in version 5.00 and higher. </p>
<!--webbot bot="Include" U-Include="../../_include/undoc500.htm" TAG="BODY" startspan -->

<p>Though this function dates from as long ago as 1999, it was still not 
documented by Microsoft in the MSDN Library at least as late as the CD edition 
dated January 2004. </p>

<h3>Use by Microsoft </h3>
<p>The <span class="function">SHRestrictionLookup</span> function is used by 
SHELL32 to support the <span class="function">
<a href="../../../../shell32/api/util/shrestricted.htm">SHRestricted</a></span> 
function, which has been documented by Microsoft among the
<a target="_top" href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms807073.aspx">
Settlement Program Interfaces</a>. </p>
<p>Another user is SHDOCVW—and, in Windows Vista, IEFRAME—to support the
<span class="function">
<a href="../../../../../ie/shdocvw/api/util/shrestricted2.htm">SHRestricted2</a></span> 
function, which was still not documented in the Software Development Kit (SDK) 
dated January 2007. </p>
<p>The <span class="function">SHRestrictionLookup</span> function is also used 
by COMDLG32 for a set of its own restrictions, just as it could be by any module 
written by any programmer who wants to provide for a set of configurable 
parameters that all default to zero. </p>
