<h1>COMCTL32 4.71 Ordinal-Only Exports </h1>
<p>Version 4.71 added to the sets of <a href="../api/da/index.htm">Dynamic Array 
functions</a> that were started as long ago as version 3.50. Of these, a handful 
were documented as
<a target="_top" href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms807073.aspx">
Settlement Program Interfaces</a> late in 2002, but more were overlooked and not 
documented for years later. Through all this, Microsoft continued its practice 
of declaring the functions as less old than they truly are, and even as much 
less: see that one of them is presented as being new to Windows Vista. </p>
<p>To be charitable, such mis-information about availability perhaps arises 
through cut-and-paste errors. This may be how the new Image List function, when 
it eventually got documented, was said to date from Windows NT 3.51, like all 
its stablemates that had been documented all along. </p>
