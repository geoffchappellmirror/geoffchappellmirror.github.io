  <h1>Revised in February 2017 </h1>
  <p>It was perhaps inevitable, but research and writing for free publication at 
  this website stops again. Were I an independently wealthy gentleman of leisure, 
  I surely would continue just for the intellectual pleasure and for the spirit 
  of providing a resource for public benefit. But I’m not. To do such work—and please 
  make no mistake that it is very intensive work—I must fund it from being consulted 
  for Windows programming that others find too hard but which I can make possible 
  and do well. I’ve known all along, if only at the back of my mind, that I can’t 
  get the best results at either the research and writing or at a consulting business 
  while I try to do both, but now I have to face it and that would seem to be the 
  end of it. </p>
  <p>When I last thought this way, back in <a href="../10/10.htm">October 2010</a>, 
  luck had it that my attention was directed to the Stuxnet worm, which had recently 
  been notorious for getting loaded just from browsing files, e.g., on removable 
  media. That this depended on shortcut (.LNK) files to Control Panel items fed 
  into two of my hobby horses. </p>
  <p>First is my long-running interest in the Windows shell as a reservoir of undocumented 
  functionality. Microsoft leveraged it for years to establish Internet Explorer. 
  Its wider value, however, is for programmers in general who might find all sorts 
  of productive interactions with it if only some way could be found of getting 
  a good proportion documented reliably. Barely a year before, in
  <a href="../09/08.htm">August 2009</a>, what had I picked as something we all 
  ought to know more about? </p>
  <blockquote>
    Yet even after nearly 15 years of the Desktop, My Computer, Control Panel, etc, 
    as everyday features of the Windows shell, it looks like much is left that might 
    usefully be documented. For instance, it seems that nobody has yet documented 
    all the ways that Control Panel items are discovered or the means by which details 
    about them are cached so that they can be enumerated without having to load 
    their CPL modules.
  </blockquote>
  <p>Second is my dissatisfaction with the quality of commercial analyses of software 
  vulnerabilities and of malware. Any investigation into anything soon becomes a 
  trade-off between going further faster and studying each detail in detail. Commercial 
  investigations in computer security too often skip past the details at the price 
  of missing what exactly it is that the software has done and depends on. This 
  is especially noticeable for malware that does something innovative—or just not 
  well appreciated—with the operating system or processor. </p>
  <p>Here for this Control Panel exploitation was malware that worked with exactly 
  some functionality that I had picked as under-documented. And here were published 
  analyses that at least glossed over the malware’s dependence on the Control Panel 
  and instead went along with Microsoft’s mis-description of the vulnerability as 
  incorrect parsing of shortcut files. I couldn’t resist then, and now that I bring 
  my latest round of research and writing to a close I couldn’t resist a trip down 
  memory lane. I’ve tidied the original page in an attempt to improve its readability. 
  A new article, <span class="citation">Control Panel Vulnerabilities</span>, is 
  published separately as <a href="../../external/pocorgtfo.htm">PoC||GTFO 14:8</a>. </p>
