<p>All samples at this website, whether program code or documentation, are free. 
You pay nothing and you are owed nothing. You take everything “as is” and you check 
it for yourself before relying on it in any way. </p>
<p>That said, I believe honestly that I have prepared all material here with at 
least as much care as could reasonably be expected even of commercial software or 
of commercial literature on programming. It is in the nature both of software development 
and of software analysis that there may be mistakes. If you discover a mistake and 
report it to me, then I shall respond at least as well as (and I hope much better 
than) any reputable software house would respond to news of a defect in a commercial 
product. However, you must understand now that although I am proud of my work, you 
should not think me liable for what you do with it. </p>
<p>Regarding the material as intellectual property, I ask first that if you use 
anything you find here, then please respect three requests that are surely so little 
burden that they ought not need mentioning in a civilised world: </p>
<ul>
  <li>acknowledge me as author; </li>
  <li>do not alter the material to misrepresent me; </li>
  <li>reproduce only what you need for fair use. </li>
</ul>
<p>In particular on this last point, it is not fair use to copy large slabs of material 
from here to another website even if you cite your source (which remarkably many 
do not). </p>
<p>Second, if your use of anything here is commercial, i.e., makes you money, even 
indirectly, as from advertising, then will you please do the decent thing and support 
this site financially. Either <a href="../consult/index.htm">consult</a> or recommend 
my consulting services whenever and wherever you can. </p>
