<h1>CSRSRV API Routines </h1>
<p>The <a href="../srvloadr/server_dll.htm">CSRSS Server DLL</a> that is built in 
to CSRSRV.DLL has never offered many API routines and most have long been implemented 
just as failing trivially. One, however, is vital. As with any API routine in any 
CSR server DLL, these can be called from a CSRSS client through the NTDLL function
<span class="function">
<a href="../../../ntdll/api/csrutil/clientcallserver.htm">CsrClientCallServer</a></span> 
and may be allowed as calls from other DLLs in the server process through the CSRSRV 
function <span class="function"><a href="../apireqst/callserverfromserver.htm">CsrCallServerFromServer</a></span>.
</p>
<p>The CSRSRV API routines each have the prototype </p>
<pre class="source">ULONG <span class="placeholder">ApiRoutine</span> (<a href="../apireqst/api_msg.htm">CSR_API_MSG</a> *, <a href="../apireqst/reply_status.htm">CSR_REPLY_STATUS</a> *);</pre>
<p>The caller selects a routine by specifying an API number. The high word is a 
0-based index which is necessarily 0 for the built-in server as a CSRSS server DLL. 
Whatever symbolic names Microsoft has for the API numbers as constants to use when 
calling the corresponding API routines are not known. The table below gives only 
the name of each API routine as known from public symbol files for CSRSRV.DLL.

<p>CSRSS was soon relieved of any role in profiling, such that the API routine
<span class="routine">CsrSrvProfileControl</span> is implemented for trivial failure 
as early as version 3.51. When version 4.0 greatly reduced the involvement of CSRSS 
in thread management, the <span class="routine">CsrSrvThreadConnect</span> routine 
was not just made to fail but was instead removed: its API number was not reassigned, 
but the corresponding pointer in the dispatch table is <span class="constant">NULL</span>.
</p>
<p>When version 5.0 removed the <span class="routine">CsrSrvNullApiCall</span>, 
for which no use is known in any version, it resequenced the API numbers. Perhaps 
with a view to not changing them ever again, it also formalises the retention of 
API numbers as mere placeholders for API routines that have no use. As each API 
number is taken out of use, the original API routine is removed and its place in 
the dispatch table is redirected to <span class="routine">CsrSrvUnusedFunction</span>. 
By version 5.2, CSRSRV has only one API routine that is not so redirected. </p>
