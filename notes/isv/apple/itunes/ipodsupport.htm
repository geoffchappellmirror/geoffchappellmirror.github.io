  <h1>iPod Support Service </h1>
  <div class="Abstract">
    <p>Recent versions of iTunes from Apple may not recognise the iPod Classic. 
    Some commentators explain this as just what to expect because this iPod is obsolete. 
    They are mistaken. </p>
    <p>Your old iPod can be used with a new iTunes, but you must download and install 
    an “iPod support service” as additional software from Apple. No, Apple is not 
    known to provide directions. </p>
  </div>
  <p>As perhaps a side-effect of aging, I have by now accumulated a few electronic 
  gadgets that might nowadays be called devices except that they don’t connect to 
  the Internet. A favourite is the iPod Classic. </p>
  <p>The iPod Classic is a sleek, shiny gizmo from Apple. I was late to acquire 
  one, having bought it not long before its discontinuation in 2014, but it’s a 
  superb example of my having not known what I had been missing. It is all but perfectly 
  adapted to its limited job of holding music on a 160GB hard disk to play back 
  either through earphones while mobile or through a hi-fi system at home. Best 
  of all, the iPod Classic can be loaded with music from CDs without ever involving 
  the Internet and it does not connect to the Internet to tell anyone what’s playing. 
  What’s not to like! </p>
  <p>There is a trade-off, of course. The iPod Classic can be so tiny and so convenient 
  for everyday use only because it has an external dependence for the occasional 
  chore of getting music onto the hard disk. As much as possible of this work is 
  removed to a separate computer. What remains is barely more than the minimum for 
  playback. Contrast with a hi-fi component that I have from the mid-90s. It has 
  a similar-sized hard disk, its own CD drive for both reading and writing, a choice 
  of analog or digital for both inputs and outputs, and so on and so forth. It’s 
  self-contained for loading music, including for recording from vinyl, and its 
  output is higher-quality than is the iPod’s, but it certainly is not portable!
  </p>
  <p>The “but” in the “all but perfect” about this trade-off that’s central to the 
  iPod Classic is that the software part of this external dependence is specifically 
  Apple’s iTunes program. </p>
  <p>Opinions surely differ but I have always thought that iTunes is very poorly 
  designed, especially when considered against the sleek device that’s my only reason 
  for using iTunes. Perhaps iTunes works better for other purposes, but it is strikingly 
  clumsy to use for importing music from CDs and organising playlists. Some of this 
  may be that although iTunes is a Windows program it is written primarily for a 
  different operating system or by programmers who are used to writing for a different 
  operating system. Too much of the program just does not work like Windows users 
  are used to from Windows programs. But the clumsiness sometimes extends to misbehaviour. 
  For instance, keystrokes or mouse clicks sometimes go unacknowledged for seconds—ten, 
  even—with no indication (as with an hourglass cursor) that delay was anticipated. 
  Possibly I make it worse by running the program without an Internet connection, 
  but even so, iTunes does not look like a program that anyone should welcome using 
  or that a company with Apple’s reputation for good design should be anything but 
  embarrassed about. </p>
  <p>Seriously, Apple, listen: if you were judged entirely on iTunes as software 
  to run on Windows, nobody would buy anything from you! </p>
  <p>With that as my perception of iTunes, you’ll understand that I’ve never been 
  keen to have it on any computer I care about and that as soon as I had my iPod 
  Classic loaded with a good selection of music, satisfyingly organised into playlists, 
  I let iTunes languish on an old computer. By now, this is a very old computer: 
  15 years old and still running Windows Vista. </p>
  <p>One trouble with old computers is that parts do eventually wear out. When I 
  thought the other day to load more music onto the iPod I was not entirely surprised 
  to find that the old computer’s DVD drive had trouble with some CDs. Thus did 
  I come to think about putting iTunes on a newer computer. The version 11.1, dated 
  2013, on the old computer was 32-bit and didn't want to install on 64-bit Windows 
  10. Thus did I come to download a new iTunes: version 12.11, dated 2021. </p>
  <h2>Problem </h2>
  <p>You download and install a new iTunes for 64-bit Windows 10, thinking to use 
  it with your old iPod Classic. The installation succeeds with no apparent trouble. 
  You run iTunes. You connect your iPod. Or you connect the iPod and then run iTunes. 
  Either way, the iPod doesn’t show in iTunes. </p>
  <p>It’s not that anything goes wrong. This problem is not about being unable to 
  sync with the iPod. It is instead that the iPod doesn’t show. Either iTunes starts 
  exactly the same as if the iPod were not connected or iTunes doesn’t react at 
  all when the iPod gets connected. </p>
  <h2>Diagnostics </h2>
  <p>On the Help menu is a command to “Run Diagnostics...” It calls up a dialog 
  that offers to run a selection of tests. The “Device connectivity tests” sound 
  relevant. Clear the others and run just this one: </p>
  <a href="_images/diagnostics_full_size.jpg">
  <img class="HiFi" alt="Diagnostics" src="_images/diagnostics_half_size.jpg" width="380" height="351">
  </a>
  <p>This is a pleasant surprise! My usual experience with built-in diagnostics 
  is that whatever has gone wrong is apparently unusual enough that the diagnostics 
  don’t find it. Here, the diagnostics actually are informative. The “iPod support 
  service is not installed”. What could be more plain? Connectivity with the iPod 
  needs an iPod support service. It’s suddenly so obvious. </p>
  <p>Also obvious is that I would better get this “iPod support service” that is 
  evidently necessary but somehow did not get installed. The dialog helpfully provides 
  me a Help button to click. Indeed, I’m given two Help buttons, one next to each 
  failed test. Text at the bottom confirms that these are each meant to get “more 
  information”, surely about the corresponding test. </p>
  <p>To spell it out: the Help button next to “iPod support service is not installed” 
  looks intended to get me to “more information” about how it is that the “iPod 
  support service is not installed” and, we might hope, about what might be done 
  to get it installed. Why do I spell this out? Of course, clicking Help gets no 
  such help. Where you get taken to on the Internet is
  <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204095?&amp;cid=acs::fm-itunes_HT204095-93716">
  If your computer doesn't recognize your iPhone, iPad, or iPod</a>. There, Apple 
  runs through the usual nonsense of suggesting that this, that or some other be 
  restarted or reinstalled. Not once does Apple even hint that the answer to their 
  question in their title may be just that you’re missing the iPod support service!
  </p>
  <p>Apple, please, lift your game! I happily join in any praise of Apple for its 
  hardware design and for its user-interface support in the hardware, such as I 
  know of Apple’s hardware from my experience of the iPod Classic. I happily add 
  that this Diagnostics feature in iTunes, albeit assessed only for this one possibly 
  very particular problem, is as good as I imagine these things ever can be. But 
  to take your users to an Internet page that then says nothing at all about what 
  your diagnostics have found is outrageously poor. </p>
  <p>Can it be that this Diagnostics dialog’s talk of this additional “iPod support 
  service” is vestigial, such that its absence is still noticed for the diagnostics 
  but is nothing Apple actively supports? Certainly, if I ask Google today, 30th 
  July 2021, to search for pages at site:apple.com that contain the text “iPod support 
  service” in quotes, all the hits are in discussions at Apple Community or Apple 
  Support Communities. Nothing is found as official documentation. Notably, Apple 
  itself seems to have nothing to say for how to download this “iPod support service”.
  </p>
  <h2>Download and Install </h2>
  <p>I have no general solution to this. If Apple for some reason has its diagnostics 
  tell you that its “iPod support service is not installed” but then Apple doesn’t 
  tell you where to get it, what can anyone do except leave you to the random-quality 
  advice you might find in the Apple Community? </p>
  <p>Though I am a reverse engineer of Windows and even occasionally of non-Microsoft 
  programs that run on Windows, I have no intention of reverse-engineering iTunes 
  to solve this problem for myself. Easier for my purpose alone would be to fit 
  a new CD drive (or plug an external CD drive) into my old computer whose old iTunes 
  has no problem with connecting to my old iPod. </p>
  <p>That said, annoy me enough and I simply can’t deny myself a little curiosity. 
  Run-Time Type Information (RTTI) in iTunesAdmin.dll makes plain that Apple’s programmers 
  defined a class named CiTunesAdminInstallIPodSupport. This same DLL also has a 
  type library which tells that an interface named IiTunesAdmin has a method named 
  InstallIPodSupport. A file named Localizable.strings has many strings in plain 
  sight that talk of “iPod Support software” including as something to download. 
  The suggestion is strong that the new iTunes as already installed does know how 
  to get the “iPod support service” but that its functionality for doing so has 
  for some reason not kicked in. </p>
  <p>For me, this was enough to try installing iTunes on yet another computer just 
  in case of getting a slightly different outcome. On this computer, connecting 
  the iPod did get a reaction from iTunes: </p>
  <a href="_images/download_full_size.jpg">
  <img class="HiFi" alt="Download and Install" src="_images/download_half_size.jpg" width="316" height="106">
  </a>
  <p>Clicking to “Download and Install” did indeed get iTunes to show the iPod. 
  This, presumably, is what Apple intends as its support: the new iTunes does support 
  an old iPod but only as an optional download of additional software. I myself 
  have no trouble with this as the support—given that the dialog to “Download and 
  Install” actually does appear! Had it appeared for the first computer that I installed 
  iTunes onto, then this page would not exist. </p>
  <h2>Transfer and Install </h2>
  <p>That iPod support works as (possibly) planned on one computer is better than 
  it working on none, but it does still leave you with a problem if the computer 
  it works on is not the one you want to keep iTunes on. </p>
  <p>Ideally, we might know why iTunes does not offer to “Download and Install” 
  the iPod support software on all computers that you connect your iPod to. Or we 
  might find how to call up this “Download and Install” dialog on demand. Or we 
  might find from Apple where on the Internet to obtain the necessary file or files 
  to download and install independently of iTunes. And we can dream. </p>
  <p>By way of immediate practicality, however, if you have one computer where iTunes 
  does present the “Download and Install” option and you want the iPod support on 
  some other computer, then you can transfer from the one to the other. There’s 
  just the one file you need to find. It’s named <span class="highlight">iPodSupport64.msi</span>. 
  You’ll still have it because the installation counts as a product for “Programs 
  and Features” in the Control Panel. It is there presented as “iPod Support”. The 
  registry entry for this product names the file. For me, it had been saved to C:\ProgramData\Apple 
  Inc\Installer Cache\iPod Support 12.11.3.7. This path may vary, but the filename 
  likely doesn’t. At worst you can search the whole disk for this one file. Copy 
  it to the computer where you want this iPod Support, and then install it, just 
  as you might for any other MSI file. </p>
  <p>Curiously—astonishingly, even—a search with Google today, 30th July 2021, for 
  the filename iPodSupport64.msi in quotes produces exactly zero matches. C’mon, 
  Apple, lift your game! While you have that the iTunes diagnostics tell that an 
  “iPod support service is not installed”, you would ideally show your users how 
  to get the thing installed, but at the very least you must provide that they can 
  easily find it through Google to download from an Apple website. </p>
