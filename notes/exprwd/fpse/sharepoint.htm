  <h1>Windows SharePoint Services for Windows Vista </h1>
  <p>These notes on problems with the <a href="index.htm">FrontPage Server Extensions</a> 
  treat the Windows SharePoint Services as FrontPage Server Extensions by another 
  name. Of course, these products are not actually the same. The Windows SharePoint 
  Services are very much bigger and more elaborate, but they include the FrontPage 
  Server Extensions, at least as far as concerns authoring and administration, and 
  whatever else they include is not relevant to these notes, no matter how substantial 
  or useful. </p>
  <p>Microsoft still distributes the Windows SharePoint Services. The current version 
  at the time of writing seems to be version 3.0 Service Pack 1. However, it does 
  not install on Windows Vista. </p>
  <p>For a sign that something is less than well thought out about this, try installing 
  the Windows SharePoint Services version 2.1 (such as supplied with FrontPage 2002) 
  on Windows Vista. A typical scenario would be that you were using FrontPage on 
  Windows XP, had been using SharePoint as a superior version of the FrontPage Server 
  Extensions for administering your staging site, and want to reproduce this configuration 
  on your new computer that’s running Windows Vista. Of course, when you installed 
  FrontPage on Windows Vista, you would have seen that although the FrontPage Server 
  Extensions that came with FrontPage have been installed, your IIS 7.0 web server 
  on Windows Vista did not get extended. Still, you might try installing SharePoint, 
  thinking that surely the worst that can happen is that you may be told the product 
  is too old for your new Windows version: </p>

  <p>Where things go wrong is when you proceed to “Check for solutions online”:
  </p>
  <img alt="Contact Microsoft Corporation for support" src="_images/contact.jpg" width="800" height="600">
  <p>Follow the link to Microsoft Corporation, and would you believe where you are 
  taken (in December 2008, if not by the time you read this note)? Yes, to Microsoft’s 
  page for

  Windows SharePoint Services 3.0 with Service Pack 1</a>. As noted above, this 
  does not install on Windows Vista. </p>
  <p>This is the sort of runaround that deservedly gets customer support a bad name. 
  Perhaps all that is meant is to help the user find the latest version of the rejected 
  product, as if any new version is better than none. But this is not good enough. 
  Since the reason for rejection is explicitly that this version of the product 
  is not supported by “this version of Windows”, no good can come of recommending 
  any upgrade that isn’t at least thought to be supported by this same version of 
  Windows. Here, Microsoft generates a very specific link to an upgrade that Microsoft 
  must know is not a solution. </p>
