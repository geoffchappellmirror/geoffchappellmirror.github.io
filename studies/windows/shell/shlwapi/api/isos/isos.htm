<h1>IsOS </h1>
<h2>Declaration </h2>
<pre class="source">BOOL IsOS (DWORD dwOS);</pre>
<h3>Parameters </h3>
<p>The <span class="argument">dwOS</span> argument selects a question about the 
operating system, or at least about the current process’s relationship with the 
operating system. Not all questions are supported in all SHLWAPI versions. Not all 
values of <span class="argument">dwOS</span> select the same question in all SHLWAPI 
versions. </p>
<h3>Return Value </h3>
<p>The function returns a non-zero value to indicate that the tested condition is 
satisfied, else the function returns FALSE. The non-zero value is not necessarily 
TRUE. </p>
<h2>Behaviour </h2>
<p>The function depends heavily, as might anyone, on the version information reported 
by the standard API function <span class="function">GetVersionEx</span>. In versions 
before 6.1, this information is sought only the first time that the
<span class="function">IsOS</span> function is called. The
<span class="function">IsOS</span> function asks first to have an
<span class="struct">OSVERSIONINFOEXA</span> structure filled, and failing that, 
an <span class="struct">OSVERSIONINFOA</span> structure. Success at getting one 
or the other is assumed. Having got (or already having) this version information, 
the function sets about interpreting it for the question implied by the
<span class="argument">dwOS</span> argument. In version 6.1 and higher, the function 
asks for version information only when needed for the particular question, and only 
then as an <span class="struct">OSVERSIONINFOEXW</span> structure, and the function 
fails (returns FALSE) if this version information is not available. </p>
<p>The function fails if <span class="argument">dwOS</span> is not one of the supported 
constants. </p>
<p>Rather than attempt a description of which versions, editions and other variations 
of Microsoft’s operating systems satisfy which questions, the following table summarises 
what the function tests to answer the question. The descriptions in terms of platform, 
version, build, product type and suite, as obtained from <span class="function">
GetVersionEx</span>, are common to many cases, as are the descriptions in terms 
of system metrics, and are explained in the section on Behaviour. Such descriptions 
are complete for most values of <span class="argument">dwOS</span>. Other cases 
are elaborated on separate pages. The table is regrettably wide, mostly to account 
for variations in what is tested by which SHLWAPI versions. </p>

<h3>Version Information </h3>
<p>To save space in the preceding table, and throughout this article, some shorthands 
are used for the members of the version information structure and the values they 
can take. None should be unclear, but they are all listed below for definiteness:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>“major version” is the <span class="member">dwMajorVersion</span> member
  </li>
  <li>“minor version” is the <span class="member">dwMinorVersion</span> member
  </li>
  <li>“version” is a standard composition of the <span class="member">dwMajorVersion</span> 
  and <span class="member">dwMinorVersion</span> members </li>
  <li>“build” is the <span class="member">dwBuildNumber</span> member </li>
  <li>“platform” is the <span class="member">dwPlatformId</span> member
  <ul>
    <li>“Windows” is <span class="constant">VER_PLATFORM_WIN32_WINDOWS</span>
    </li>
    <li>“NT” is <span class="constant">VER_PLATFORM_WIN32_NT</span> </li>
  </ul>
  </li>
  <li>“suite” is the <span class="member">wSuiteMask</span> member, understood in 
  terms of bit flags, so that it <span class="definition">is</span> whichever bits 
  are set and it <span class="definition">is not</span> whichever bits are clear
  <ul>
    <li>“small business” is <span class="constant">VER_SUITE_SMALLBUSINESS</span>
    </li>
    <li>“enterprise” is <span class="constant">VER_SUITE_ENTERPRISE</span> </li>
    <li>“terminal” is <span class="constant">VER_SUITE_TERMINAL</span> </li>
    <li>“small business restricted” is <span class="constant">VER_SUITE_SMALLBUSINESS_RESTRICTED</span>
    </li>
    <li>“embedded” is <span class="constant">VER_SUITE_EMBEDDEDNT</span> </li>
    <li>“data center” is <span class="constant">VER_SUITE_DATACENTER</span> </li>
    <li>“single user” is <span class="constant">VER_SUITE_SINGLEUSERTS</span>
    </li>
    <li>“personal” is <span class="constant">VER_SUITE_PERSONAL</span> </li>
    <li>“blade” is <span class="constant">VER_SUITE_BLADE</span> </li>
    <li>“storage server” is <span class="constant">VER_SUITE_STORAGE_SERVER</span>
    </li>
    <li>“compute server” is <span class="constant">VER_SUITE_COMPUTE_SERVER</span>
    </li>
    <li>“home server” is <span class="constant">VER_SUITE_WH_SERVER</span> </li>
  </ul>
  </li>
  <li>“product type” is the <span class="member">wProductType</span> member
  <ul>
    <li>“workstation” is <span class="constant">VER_NT_WORKSTATION</span> </li>
    <li>“domain controller” is <span class="constant">VER_NT_DOMAIN_CONTROLLER</span>
    </li>
    <li>“server” is <span class="constant">VER_NT_SERVER</span> </li>
  </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<h4>Suite </h4>
<p>The <span class="member">wSuiteMask</span> member lies in the extension from
<span class="struct">OSVERSIONINFO</span> to <span class="struct">OSVERSIONINFOEX</span>, 
and even though the extended structure is sought by all exported implementations 
of <span class="function">IsOS</span>, this member is not interpreted until the 
builds of version 5.0 from Windows 2000. Earlier builds work instead with a registry 
value: </p>
<table class="Registry">
  <tr>
    <td>Key </td>
    <td><span class="regvalue">HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\ProductOptions</span>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Value </td>
    <td><span class="regvalue">ProductType</span> </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Type </td>
    <td><span class="constant">REG_SZ</span> </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>The string data <span class="regsz">Enterprise</span> and <span class="regsz">
DataCenter</span> are then treated as equivalent to “suite is enterprise” and “suite 
is data center” respectively. As with the version information, the function seeks 
this registry value only when first called (per-process). </p>
<p>In the following cases, which all involve testing the <span class="member">wSuiteMask</span> 
member for a single flag, the function does not return TRUE if the flag is set, 
but instead returns the flag: </p>
<ul>
  <li><span class="constant">OS_EMBEDDED</span> </li>
  <li><span class="constant">OS_WEBSERVER</span> </li>
  <li><span class="constant">OS_SMALLBUSINESSSERVER</span> </li>
  <li>undocumented case 0x28, only in variation for Windows Server 2003 </li>
  <li>undocumented case 0x29, only in variation for Windows Server 2003 </li>
  <li>undocumented case 0x2B, only in variation for Windows Server 2003 </li>
</ul>
<h4>Variations </h4>
<p>The change in <span class="constant">OS_WIN2000ORGREATER</span> (0x07) for version 
6.0 makes it an alias for the undocumented case 0x04. The latter is in fact the 
original, dating from versions 4.71 and 4.72 when <span class="function">IsOS</span> 
was coded in both SHLWAPI and SHDOCVW but not exported from either. The documented 
case 0x07 does have the merit of a better fit with the chronology of releases: case 
0x04 was being used, e.g., by SHDOCVW in Internet Explorer 4.0, to distinguish “Windows 
2000 or greater” some two years before Windows 2000 was released. </p>
<p>The change in <span class="constant">OS_WIN95_GOLD</span> is presumably a bug 
fix, the earlier coding having picked an incorrect build number. </p>
<p>Note that the early test for <span class="constant">OS_WIN2000TERMINAL</span> 
was not discarded: it got reused as <span class="constant">OS_TERMINALCLIENT</span>.
</p>
<h4>Hard Coding </h4>
<p>For some values of <span class="argument">dwOS</span>, version 6.1 returns a 
hard-coded result that is consistent with the question as understood by previous 
versions: </p>
<table class="Constants">
  <tr>
    <th>Case </th>
    <th>Hard Coded Evaluation </th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><span class="constant">OS_NT</span> <br>
    <span class="constant">OS_NT4ORGREATER</span> <br>
    <span class="constant">OS_XPORGREATER</span> </td>
    <td>TRUE in 6.1 and higher </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><span class="constant">OS_WIN95ORGREATER</span> <br>
    <span class="constant">OS_WIN98ORGREATER</span> <br>
    <span class="constant">OS_WIN98GOLD</span> <br>
    <span class="constant">OS_WIN95_GOLD</span> <br>
    <span class="constant">OS_MEORGREATER</span> </td>
    <td>FALSE in 6.1 and higher </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>It is not known why the function takes for granted that it is running on Windows 
XP or greater but still tests whether it is running on Windows 2000 or greater.
</p>
<h3>System Metrics </h3>
<p>A handful of cases are answered by calling the standard API function
<span class="function">GetSystemMetrics</span> to obtain a particular system metric. 
Where such cases are described in the preceding table as “evaluation of system metric”, 
the function returns exactly whatever is returned by <span class="function">GetSystemMetrics</span>, 
without regard for whether this is TRUE or FALSE. </p>
<h2>Availability </h2>
<p>The <span class="function">IsOS</span> function is exported from SHLWAPI as ordinal 
437 in version 5.0 and higher. Starting with version 6.0 from Windows Vista, the 
function is also exported by name. </p>
<p>It exists earlier, in both SHLWAPI and SHDOCVW from Internet Explorer 4.0 in 
1997, but only as an internal routine. </p>
<h3>Documentation Status </h3>
<!--webbot bot="Include" U-Include="../_include/undoc500.htm" TAG="BODY" startspan -->

<p>Though this function dates from as long ago as 1999, it was still not 
documented by Microsoft in the MSDN Library at least as late as the CD edition 
dated January 2004. </p>

<!--webbot bot="Include" i-checksum="43429" endspan -->
<!--webbot bot="Include" U-Include="../_include/doc2004.htm" TAG="BODY" startspan -->

<p>However, the function did eventually get documented, apparently later in 
2004. This article now conforms to Microsoft’s nomenclature. </p>

<!--webbot bot="Include" i-checksum="39468" endspan -->
<p>Note that Microsoft is hardly rushing to keep its new documentation up to date. 
The several new cases of <span class="argument">dwOS</span> that are supported in 
Windows XP SP2, Windows Server 2003 SP1 and Windows Vista were not yet documented 
by Microsoft in the Windows Vista SDK dated January 2007. Some names for these undocumented 
cases are inferred from the names of subroutines in version 6.1. </p>
<p>A substantial revision of the SDK documentation, apparently done some time during 
2008 or 2009, seems intended to describe the function as it behaves in SHLWAPI version 
6.1, but notes that “Values are not provided for Windows Vista and Windows 7.” An 
alternative is suggested. This is just as well. As shown above, some of the “values” 
introduced since Windows XP SP2 are interpreted very differently depending on which 
SHLWAPI version is asked. This is no problem for Microsoft’s own use of
<span class="function">IsOS</span> in Internet Explorer, since SHLWAPI is linked 
statically into the IEFRAME executable and Microsoft therefore has complete control 
of which version of the SHLWAPI code is called. The situation is different for programs 
that import from SHLWAPI. These may find themselves calling any of a wide variety 
of SHLWAPI versions. They are therefore exposed to such problems as getting a false 
positive from <span class="constant">OS_WIN7ORGREATER</span> if they happen to be 
running on certain editions of certain builds of Windows Server 2003. For such reasons, 
many of these new <span class="argument">dwOS</span> values really would be much 
better left alone. Whether this is why Microsoft does not update its documentation 
to cover these new values is, of course, not known. </p>
