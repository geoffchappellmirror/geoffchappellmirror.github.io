<h1>The Service Control Manager Eventlog Provider </h1>
<p>Events that SERVICES.EXE writes to the System log are most easily identified 
in the Event Viewer as the ones whose source is listed as Service Control Manager 
Eventlog Provider. However, that is just a localised friendly name, as picked up 
from a manifest. The formal name of the event provider itself is just Service Control 
Manager. This is what’s stored in the registry. It is what you will see on the Details 
tab for an event in the Event Viewer, and it is the name you need if controlling 
this provider through such tools as WEVTUTIL or the Reliability and Performance 
Monitor. </p>
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>Provider Name: </td>
    <td>Service Control Manager </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Provider GUID: </td>
    <td>{555908D1-A6D7-4695-8E1E-26931D2012F4} </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Symbolic Name for GUID: </td>
    <td><span class="symbol">S_Service_Control_Manager</span> </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>Events from this provider get to the System log in the Event Viewer because Windows 
is set up so that the registry has this provider already configured as a publisher 
to the Eventlog-System session. </p>
<p>It may be as well to explain here that when SERVICES fires these events to the 
System log, it is not a manifest-based provider despite coming with an instrumentation 
manifest, nor is it exactly what the documentation refers to as a classic provider. 
The way it fires events is a little exotic. Early versions are straightforward users 
of the functions that Microsoft documents for Event Logging, such as
<span class="function">RegisterEventSource</span> and <span class="function">ReportEvent</span>, 
but there was a significant recoding for Windows XP. SERVICES is nowadays a Windows 
Management Instrumentation (WMI) event provider, and specifically a decoupled non-COM 
provider. The non-COM aspect is undocumented. Indeed, the page
<a target="_top" href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/aa392783.aspx">Provider 
Hosting and Security</a> from the Windows SDK states explicitly that the Decoupled:Noncom 
hosting model is “for internal use only” and is “not supported”. SERVICES is one 
of its very few users. It relies on undocumented functions such as
<span class="function">WmiEventSourceConnect</span>, <span class="function">WmiCreateObjectWithFormat</span> 
and <span class="function">WmiSetAndCommitObject</span> that are implemented in 
NCOBJAPI.DLL. </p>
<p>The WMI provider in SERVICES calls itself the SCM Event Provider, in the root\cimv2 
namespace. Aside from using the non-COM API, delivery into the event log is as straightforward 
as for any WMI event provider. Each possible event is a managed object and is represented 
by a WMI class. Parameters that can be passed with the event are represented as 
members of the class. The name of the class and the names of the parameters are 
hard-coded in SERVICES, which registers them at run-time with WMI. The mapping of 
these managed objects to Windows events depends on matching their names with definitions 
that have been compiled into the WMI repository from a source file named SCM.MOF 
(supplied in the WBEM subdirectory of the Windows system directory). </p>
<p>By contrast, consumption of these events in Windows Vista is bang up-to-date. 
Presentation in the Event Viewer depends on definitions in an instrumentation manifest, 
which Microsoft supplies as an <span class="tag">&lt;instrumentation&gt;</span> block 
within the manifest that represents SERVICES as an assembly. Refer to the separate 
note about <a href="../versions.htm">SERVICES Versions</a> for the name and location. 
The instrumentation manifest is also compiled into the SERVICES resources, as WEVT_TEMPLATE.
</p>
<p>That these events are provided through MOF files but consumed through manifests 
turns out to have practical consequence, albeit very slight: as shown below, an 
error in the MOF file means that two events become one. Presumably, this has not 
confused anyone, else Microsoft might have corrected it by now. </p>
<p>Another consequence, but one which is noted only for completeness, is that the 
symbolic name for the provider GUID, as given in the manifest, is not actually used 
in the SERVICES code. </p>
<h2>Possible Events </h2>
<p>The large table that follows lists all the events that SERVICES registers with 
WMI for firing to the System log (not that this necessarily means that all these 
events actually can occur). Descriptions are reproduced from the relevant manifest 
and message-table resource in the SERVICES executable. Since the instrumentation 
manifest names the parameters only as <span class="placeholder">param1</span>,
<span class="placeholder">param2</span>, etc, placeholders in the descriptions are 
instead resolved below from definitions in the SERVICES code and in SCM.MOF. </p>

<p>Event 7019 is unusual in that it originates in SERVICES.EXE as two distinct events. 
(The WMI class names are <span class="class">MSFT_NetDependOnLaterService</span> 
and <span class="class">MSFT_NetDependOnLaterGroup</span>.) That SCM.MOF translates 
them both to 7019 looks to be an editing error. The latter would better translate 
to 7020, which is indeed what the manifest gives as the value for the event that 
it represents as <span class="symbol">EVENT_DEPEND_ON_LATER_GROUP</span>. The obvious 
experiment of setting a service’s <span class="regvalue">DependOnGroup</span> to 
name a later-loading group does indeed produce event 7019 instead of 7020, confirming 
that these events are delivered into the event log classically, i.e., using MOF 
files rather than a manifest. </p>
<p>In the description given above for event 7036, the second placeholder is reproduced 
correctly as <span class="placeholder">Control</span>, though clearly it does not 
stand for a control but a status. See the SCM.MOF entry for <span class="class">
MSFT_NetServiceStatusSuccess</span>. The grammatical error in the description of 
event 7003 is also reproduced from Microsoft. </p>
<p>A few events have parameters that are not used for the descriptions. Events 7031 
and 7032 have an <span class="placeholder">ActionType</span>, as the fourth and 
first parameter respectively. Events 7035, 7040 and 7042 each have a
<span class="placeholder">sid</span> as the last parameter. Event 7041 has an
<span class="placeholder">Error</span> as the last parameter, but it can only be 
0x0569 (<span class="constant">ERROR_LOGON_TYPE_NOT_GRANTED</span>), else the event 
would have been 7038. </p>
<p>For several events, comments in SCM.MOF suggest descriptive text that is slightly 
different (and sometimes very different) from what is shown above. They are just 
comments. What counts for display in the Event Viewer is what’s found in the manifest. 
That said, the manifest and the message-table resource in SERVICES.EXE both provide 
the following messages for IDs which SERVICES.EXE cannot ever fire as events and 
which SCM.MOF does not translate. Except for 7020, as discussed above, they are 
perhaps obsolete. </p>
