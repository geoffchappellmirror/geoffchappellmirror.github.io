<h1>Travel Logs </h1>
<p>Travel logs were introduced with Internet Explorer 4.00 to model a navigation 
of potentially many URLs with the thought of sometimes moving backwards and 
forwards through the set. The travel log is therefore an ordered set of travel 
entries. One entry is current. Others are some distance forward or backward. </p>
<h2>Interfaces </h2>
<p>The travel log implementation, named <span class="class">CTravelLog</span> 
according to Microsoft’s published symbol files, exposes the interfaces: </p>
<ul>
  <li><span class="interface"><a href="itravellog.htm">ITravelLog</a></span>
  </li>
  <li><span class="interface"><a href="itravellogex/index.htm">ITravelLogEx</a></span>
  </li>
  <li><span class="interface"><a href="itravellog2.htm">ITravelLog2</a></span>
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>Travel Entries </h3>
<p>Travel entries are creatable only by calling methods of the travel log, 
specifically
<span class="method">AddEntry</span> or <span class="method">InsertEntry</span> 
(being respectively an original and an improvement), or by calling an existing 
entry’s
<span class="method">Clone</span> method. </p>
<p>Each entry is implemented as an instance of an internal class named
<span class="class">CTravelEntry</span>, which exposes the interfaces: </p>
<ul>
  <li><span class="interface"><a href="itravelentry.htm">ITravelEntry</a></span>
  </li>
  <li><span class="interface"><a href="itravelentry2.htm">ITravelEntry2</a></span>
  </li>
  <li><span class="interface"><a href="itravellogentry.htm">ITravelLogEntry</a></span>
  </li>
  <li><span class="interface">IPropertyBag</span> </li>
</ul>
<p>Of the travel log’s other methods that provide access to a selected entry, 
some produce the entry’s <span class="interface">ITravelEntry</span> interface, 
others the <span class="interface">ITravelLogEntry</span> interface. </p>
<h3>Enumeration </h3>
<p>Travel entries can be enumerated by calling the travel log’s
<span class="method">CreateEnumEntry</span> method. This creates an instance of 
yet another internal class, named <span class="class">CEnumEntry</span>, which 
exposes the one interface: </p>
<ul>
  <li><span class="interface"><a href="ienumtravellogentry.htm">
  IEnumTravelLogEntry</a></span>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Accessing an entry through the enumerator produces the entry’s
<span class="interface">ITravelLogEntry</span> interface. </p>
<h2>Instantiation </h2>
<p>Instances are created internally, most notably to support the
<span class="coclass">CBaseBrowser</span> class, and can be obtained by calling 
the <span class="method">GetTravelLog</span> method of an
<span class="interface">IBrowserService</span> interface. </p>
<p>However, that way is deprecated, if only for non-Microsoft programmers. Since 
Internet Explorer 5.50, Microsoft has provided that a browser’s travel log be 
accessed indirectly, through a <a href="public/index.htm">public travel log</a> 
that exposes a reduced but supposedly adequate functionality. This is 
implemented very much as an extra layer. The <span class="method">GetTravelLog</span> 
call is still made, but as an internal detail for the browser. To have a browser 
create a public travel log, query the browser for its <span class="constant">
SID_STravelLogCursor</span> 
service. </p>
<p>Starting with Windows Vista, travel logs are creatable using standard COM 
functions such as <span class="function">CoCreateInstance</span> by anyone who 
knows the CLSID. Indeed, there are two, since the supporting code has been moved 
to IEFRAME and SHELL32:
</p>
<table>
  <tr>
    <td><span class="constant">CLSID_TravelLog</span> </td>
    <td><span class="clsid">{34A3D570-67D9-4265-A9EE-8C3FA3DFECCF}</span> </td>
    <td>IEFRAME </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><span class="constant">CLSID_ShellTravelLog</span> </td>
    <td><span class="clsid">{D58960BA-2EF3-4910-9E34-C911B1710180}</span> </td>
    <td>SHELL32 </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<h2>Availability </h2>
<p>Travel logs are supported in SHDOCVW version 4.71 and higher, until the 
supporting code was moved to IEFRAME version 7.00 and the Windows Vista build of 
SHELL32 version 6.00. The original interfaces are <span class="interface">
ITravelLog</span> and
<span class="interface">ITravelEntry</span>. The first significant improvement 
was for version 5.50, which added <span class="interface">ITravelLogEx</span>,
<span class="interface">ITravelLogEntry</span> and <span class="interface">
IEnumTravelLogEntry</span>. Windows Vista adds <span class="interface">
ITravelLog2</span> and
<span class="interface">ITravelEntry2</span>. </p>
<p>Though <span class="interface">ITravelLog</span> and <span class="interface">
ITravelEntry</span> date from as long ago as 1997, they were still undocumented 
as late as the January 2004 edition of the MSDN Library on CD. They have got 
documented since, albeit as being deprecated. None of <span class="interface">
ITravelLogEx</span>,
<span class="interface">ITravelLog2</span>, <span class="interface">
ITravelEntry2</span> 
are documented in the January 2007 edition of the Software Development Kit (SDK) 
for Windows Vista. </p>
