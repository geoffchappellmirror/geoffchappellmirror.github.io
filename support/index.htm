  <h1>Support This Site </h1>
  <p>There are more than 3,000 pages at this website. Put aside the placeholders 
  for work that has never properly got under way, and very nearly all the other 
  pages at this website are original research, all offered for free as a public 
  good. </p>
  <p>At first I funded all this work from the proceeds of consultation services 
  years before when I did very much less research and kept the results to myself. 
  Later I funded it by trying to fit consultation and reearch together, mostly by 
  giving up my nights and weekends. I have been mostly happy to spend my time and 
  money on this research-and-writing just to see what can be achieved, but I can’t 
  keep doing it without substantial help. </p>
  <p>If I had any business skills or were any good at raising funding, I would likely 
  be no good at the research or the writing, let alone at both, and I doubt I’d 
  have imagined that such research and writing are even possible. Without full-time 
  funding, they pretty much are impossible. </p>
  <p>If you value this website as a public good, then please recommend it to people 
  who have the resources to fund it and may have the will. If all you have is an 
  idea for possible funding, it’s very possibly more than occurs to me with my limited 
  mind for these things, so please
  <a href="mailto:feedback@geoffchappell.com?subject=Suggestion%20for%20Funding">
  send me your suggestion</a>. </p>
  <p>Although I am convinced now that research of a high standard demands full-time 
  attention—indeed, commitment—the fact is that the second-best way to get the research 
  funded is to divert some time to commercial consultation, i.e., using skills and 
  knowledge from the research to solve real-world problems for a fee. If you can’t 
  help me find full-time funding, then by far the best support is to recommend my
  <a href="../consult/index.htm">consultation services</a> as widely and strongly 
  as you can. </p>
