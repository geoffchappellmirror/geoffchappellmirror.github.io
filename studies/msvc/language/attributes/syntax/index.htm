<h1>C++ Attribute Syntax </h1>
<p>Given Microsoft’s talk of attributes as extending “C++ in directions not 
currently possible without breaking the classic structure of the language”, one 
might reasonably expect that the product documentation would describe with some 
precision what Microsoft has done to the classic language’s grammar and syntax 
in order to accommodate attributes.
</p>
<p>That something significant has been done is plain enough from the error 
messages produced by compiling just the following few lines: </p>
<pre class="source">1;

[
    2
];</pre>
<p>The two numbers are nonsensical, of course, yet the error messages speak of 
the first number as a constant and of the second as a string. The first is 
consistent with the product documentation’s description of the C++ language. The 
second is a simple indication that attribute blocks are treated to very 
different preprocessing from ordinary C++ source code. The error message is not 
mistaken. It truly is that numerical constants in attribute blocks are tokenised 
as strings. </p>
<p>Put aside that purists would not even stoop to debate this as “breaking the 
classic structure of the language”. Ask instead how anyone at Microsoft can have 
implemented such different preprocessing and not thought to document it, at 
least not in obvious places such as the product documentation’s <span class="citation">
C++ Language Reference</span> 
or its <span class="citation">C++ Attributes Reference</span>. </p>
<p>Even more puzzling are the product documentation’s indirect suggestions of 
the different preprocessing, as where the <span class="citation">Attribute 
Programming FAQ</span> asks “can I use comments in an attribute block?” For this 
to have counted with anyone as a frequently-asked question, some real-world 
programmer doing real-world work with C++ attributes (though possibly only at 
Microsoft, working for Microsoft) presumably was surprised to find that comments 
are sometimes not recognised in attribute blocks. But if they are not—and, 
indeed, they sometimes are not—then it can only be because attribute blocks have 
their own preprocessing, this being the stage at which comments are ordinarily 
discarded from C++ code. </p>
<p>Perhaps it is all taken as understood, given references to C++ attributes as 
having developed from IDL attributes in the Microsoft Interface Definition 
Language (MIDL). </p>
