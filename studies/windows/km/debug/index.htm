  <h1>Debugging </h1>
  <p>You could not possibly overstate the importance of debugging in kernel-mode 
  programming. By debugging here, I mean the interruption of a machine’s execution 
  for examination and control. There are application programmers who have never—even 
  in decades of highly regarded achievement—done any significant debugging of this 
  sort but have instead been content to sprinkle their code with diversions that 
  trace their programs’ execution and allow the deduction of defects by inspecting 
  logs. This has its place in kernel-mode debugging too. Indeed, it is sometimes 
  all that’s available because the act of interrupting the machine’s execution so 
  much disturbs this execution that the defect no longer shows. Generally, though, 
  you can’t do much kernel-mode programming without proficiency at breaking to a 
  debugger for close inspection of registers and memory and at using the debugger 
  to step through the machine’s execution. </p>
  <p>My purpose, however, is not to give some overview of kernel-mode debugging. 
  It’s even less to instruct on debugging. I must assume that skill at kernel-mode 
  debugging is a skill you already have or are at least well on the way to developing. 
  Anyway, since I myself think I’ve had this skill to take for granted for three 
  decades and mostly taught myself by disassembling the debuggers, I have no experience 
  of books or courses for you to learn from and I therefore have none to recommend.
  </p>
  <p>That said, one source of guidance about kernel-mode debugging stands out. Because 
  Microsoft needs that programmers can debug their code (the programmers’, if not 
  Microsoft’s), Microsoft of course documents its Debugging Tools for Windows. What 
  concerns me for this section of my website is the disparity between what I imagine 
  is a typical first view of Microsoft’s documentation and what I see when looking 
  into the details. </p>
  <p>At first glance, Microsoft looks to have documented its Debugging Tools for 
  Windows extensively. There are numerous pages of directions for set up and use, 
  of guidance and technique, and especially of reference, with page after page for 
  each of very many commands. Someone new to debugging or an expert at it on a different 
  operating system might easily take this in as substantial and extensive, and perhaps 
  even as detailed and comprehensive. In many ways, they would not be wrong. </p>
