<h1>KERNELBASE Versions </h1>
<p>KERNELBASE.DLL was introduced for Windows 7, mostly from code that was originally 
in KERNEL32.DLL or ADVAPI32.DLL. </p>

<h2>Builds </h2>
<!--webbot bot="Include" U-Include="../../_include/builds.htm" TAG="BODY" startspan -->

<p>The following builds have been inspected for these notes. Most are from MSDN 
discs. Some, especially since Microsoft greatly reduced its shipment of operating 
systems on MSDN discs, are from service packs downloaded (typically as self-extracting 
executables) from a Microsoft website. </p>
<p>Builds are arranged in increasing order of the file version as recorded in the 
executable’s resources. This version number is readily visible using Windows Explorer 
either in a so-called infotip for the file or by accessing the Version tab in the 
Properties dialog for the file. Programmers know this version number as coming from 
the so-called root block of the version-information resource, specifically from 
the <span class="member">dwFileVersionMS</span> and <span class="member">dwFileVersionLS</span> 
members of a <span class="struct">VS_FIXEDFILEINFO</span> structure. </p>
<p>The date stamp shown for each version is more obscure. File dates are easily 
modified after the executable is built and are anyway liable to be shown differently 
when read from different time zones. However, there is in each executable’s header 
a date stamp which is set when the executable is built and which is not commonly 
changed afterwards. It is readily accessible to anyone with programming knowledge 
and appropriate tools, e.g., Microsoft’s own DUMPBIN utility. </p>

<p>Note the rapid increase in size as ever more functionality—indeed, most of the 
bread and butter of Windows programming—moves to KERNELBASE from long-established 
homes in KERNEL32 and ADVAPI32. </p>
<h3>64-Bit Windows (amd64) </h3>
<!--webbot bot="Include" U-Include="../../_include/builds64.htm" TAG="BODY" startspan -->

<p>Microsoft’s distribution of early 64-bit Windows on MSDN discs is even less reliable 
than is my renewal of subscriptions. I seem never to have received a 64-bit edition 
of Windows XP. Since a subscription in 2007 produced no x64 build of the original 
Windows Vista, the copy inspected of that is from an OEM disc. The builds inspected 
for service packs are from self-extracting executables that have been downloaded 
from a free Microsoft website (which is, curiously, an order of magnitude faster 
than downloading disc images from the paid MSDN website). </p>

<p>The executables for Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2 are identical. This 
identity is formalised for Windows 7 SP1 and Windows Server 2008 R2 SP1 since 
Microsoft provides the one self-extracting executable for both product names. </p>
<h3>32-Bit Windows on 64-Bit Windows (wow64) </h3>
<p>KERNELBASE is sufficiently low-level that its 32-bit executables for 64-bit Windows 
differ from those of the corresponding 32-bit Windows versions. </p>
