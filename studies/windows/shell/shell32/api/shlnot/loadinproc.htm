<h1>SHLoadInProc </h1>
<p>This function loads a DLL into the Windows Explorer process. </p>
<h2>Declaration </h2>
<pre class="source">HRESULT SHLoadInProc (REFCLSID rclsid);</pre>
<h3>Parameters </h3>
<p>The <span class="argument">rclsid</span> argument provides the CLSID of any 
COM object class for which the intended DLL is the in-process server. </p>
<h3>Return Value </h3>
<!--webbot bot="Include" U-Include="../_include/hresult.htm" TAG="BODY" startspan -->

<p>The function returns zero for success, else an error code. </p>

<h2>Behaviour (SHELL32) </h2>
<p>Though SHELL32 implements the function, its role is just that of a 
switchboard, to direct the call to the taskbar. If there is no top-level window 
with the class name expected of the taskbar, namely “Shell_TrayWnd”, then the 
function has nowhere to send the request, and fails (returning <span class="constant">
E_FAIL</span>).
</p>
<p>The taskbar may be, and typically is, implemented in another process. The 
given CLSID is communicated to the taskbar window by sending it as data in a
<span class="message"><a href="copydata.htm">WM_COPYDATA</a></span> message. 
Whatever is returned from sending this message is then returned by the function. </p>
<h2>Behaviour (EXPLORER) </h2>
<p>With one exception, the response to the message is just to create an instance 
of the given object class and immediately release it. The exception is that if 
the given CLSID is <span class="clsid">{EA486701-7F92-11CF-9E05-444553540000}</span>, 
then the message handler fails the function (with <span class="constant">E_FAIL</span> 
as the return value). Otherwise, the function’s return value is whatever HRESULT 
was produced by trying to create the object. </p>
<p>Note that the point to the function is not directly anything to do with the 
given object class but with whatever DLL is the in-process server for that 
object class. The action of creating an instance only to destroy it immediately 
is enough to get this DLL loaded into the process that implements the taskbar 
window (typically the Windows Explorer) and thus to get code executed in the 
context of that process.
</p>
<h2>Availability </h2>
<p>The <span class="function">SHLoadInProc</span> function is exported by name 
from all known SHELL32 versions. It has long been documented. </p>
<p>This is an ancient SHELL32 function. It is found in version 1.30 from Win32s 
and 3.51 from Windows NT 3.51, though admittedly with implementations that fail 
trivially (returning <span class="constant">E_NOTIMPL</span> having done nothing 
but set <span class="constant">ERROR_CALL_NOT_IMPLEMENTED</span> as the error 
code). The function has been “live” since version 4.00. </p>
<p>From the Windows Vista build of version 6.00 onwards, <span class="function">
SHLoadInProc</span> is coded for trivial failure, so that it does nothing but 
return
<span class="constant">E_NOTIMPL</span>. </p>
