<h1>SYSTEM_LOOKASIDE_INFORMATION </h1>
<p>An array of <span class="struct">SYSTEM_LOOKASIDE_INFORMATION</span> structures 
is what a successful call to <span class="function"><a href="query.htm">ZwQuerySystemInformation</a></span> 
or <span class="function">NtQuerySystemInformation</span> produces in its output 
buffer when given the information class <span class="constant">SystemLookasideInformation</span> 
(0x2D). Each structure describes one of the kernel’s typically very many lookaside 
lists. </p>
<h2>Documentation Status </h2>
<p>The <span class="struct">SYSTEM_LOOKASIDE_INFORMATION</span> structure is defined 
in WINTERNL.H from the Software Development Kit (SDK). The definition there has 
the whole structure as one array of bytes, named <span class="member">Reserved1</span>. 
Documentation of <span class="function">NtQuerySystemInformation</span> describes 
the structure as “opaque” and suggests that whatever is produced in it for the
<span class="constant">SystemLookasideInformation</span> case “can be used to generate 
an unpredictable seed for a random number generator.” </p>
<p>An irony about the documentation’s reluctance to say much is that what little 
it does say is even more unhelpful than may first seem. The caller who is not told 
that the function can produce an array of these structures will, unsurprisingly, 
not to think to provide an information buffer that can receive more than one structure. 
Indeed, the documentation talks only in the singular. What gets produced for this 
one structure is in practice utterly useless as the supposed “unpredictable seed” 
because it will almost always be exactly the same—not just from time to time but 
even on different computers. The reason is that the enumeration begins with a lookaside 
list for optimising non-paged pool allocations of up to eight bytes (and specifically 
then by code that runs on the boot processor), and these are so rare that this lookaside 
list typically shows no activity since its initialisation. </p>
<!--webbot bot="Include" U-Include="_include/type_info_urlmon.htm" TAG="BODY" startspan -->

<p>Microsoft does publish the practical equivalent of a C-language definition as 
type information in public symbol files, though not for the kernel, where the structure 
is prepared, nor even for low-level user-mode DLLs that interpret the structure, 
but for various higher-level user-mode DLLs such as URLMON.DLL and only then starting 
with version 6.2. </p>

<!--webbot bot="Include" U-Include="_include/type_info_shell32.htm" TAG="BODY" startspan -->

<p>One earlier disclosure of type information is known, though not in any symbol 
file but instead in what would otherwise be just an import library for SHELL32.DLL 
and only then as supplied with the Device Driver Kit (DDK) for Windows NT 4.0.

<p>Though the members are mostly just copied from corresponding members in the lookaside 
list (whose layout is documented), some interpretation does occur. The reported
<span class="member">CurrentDepth</span> is in fact the <span class="member">Depth</span> 
from the <span class="struct">SLIST_HEADER</span> that acts as the lookaside list’s 
cache. Confusingly, the <span class="member">MaximumDepth</span> in the information 
is not the <span class="member">MaximumDepth</span> from the lookaside list itself 
but just its plain <span class="member">Depth</span>. </p>
<p>The lookaside lists that optimise pool allocations are worked on only by the 
Executive’s code for pool management and have the slightly different implementation 
of counting <span class="member">AllocateHits</span> and <span class="member">FreeHits</span> 
where other lookaside lists count <span class="member">AllocateMisses</span> and
<span class="member">FreeMisses</span>. For these lists, the “misses” counts in 
the information are of course computed by subtracting the hits from the totals.
</p>
<p>For the general lookaside lists, as initialised by exported functions such as
<span class="function">ExInitializeLookasideEx</span>, the reported
<span class="member">Type</span> is specifically <span class="constant">NonPagedPool</span> 
or <span class="constant">PagedPool</span>. Put another way, other bits that may 
have been specified for the pool type are not disclosed. This seems now like it 
must be an oversight, but it may have been deliberate in the days when the
<span class="function">ExInitializeNPagedLookasideList</span> and
<span class="function">ExInitializePagedLookasideList</span> functions were documented 
as requiring that their <span class="argument">Flags</span> argument be zero.
