  <h1>MMPFN Union 3 </h1>
  <p>The <span class="struct"><a href="index.htm">MMPFN</a></span> (Memory Manager 
  Page Frame Number) structure is the key to pretty much everything that the Memory 
  Manager knows about a page of physical memory that is in general use. Since an 
  array of these structures for all physical memory needs to be kept in physical 
  memory, the <span class="struct">MMPFN</span> is its own substantial overhead. 
  Presumably to keep this down, ever more gets packed in to the
  <span class="struct">MMPFN</span> ever more intricately. </p>
  <p>However untidy the construction of the <span class="struct">MMPFN</span>, it 
  has several fields that are recognisably the same through all versions despite 
  moving around and being repackaged. All versions have an integral reference count. 
  Early versions have it as variously 16-bit or 32-bit, but as a direct member of 
  the <span class="struct">MMPFN</span>. Public symbol files starting with Windows 
  2000 SP3 show a <span class="member">u3</span> member that combines the 16-bit
  <span class="member">ReferenceCount</span> with 16 bits of flags, and it is here 
  thought that this or something very like it had already been defined for version 
  4.0. As a type, <span class="member">u3</span> is an unnamed union. It shifts 
  once within the <span class="struct">MMPFN</span>: </p>
  <table class="Union">
    <colgroup>
      <col class="Offset" span="2">
    </colgroup>
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th><span class="struct">MMPFN</span> Offset (x86) </th>
        <th><span class="struct">MMPFN</span> Offset (x64) </th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td>0x0C (4.0 to 6.3); <br>
        0x14 </td>
        <td>0x18 (late 5.2 to 6.3); <br>
        0x20 </td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
  <p>The <span class="member">u3</span> union is almost certainly not original. 
  The only known use that the earliest versions make of this space is for two 16-bit 
  counts. Both versions 3.10 and 3.50 have at offset 0x0C something very like the 
  16-bit <span class="member">ReferenceCount</span> as known from public symbol 
  files but they have at offset 0x0E a second 16-bit count whose name may be lost 
  to history. Version 3.51 dropped this second count in favour of widening
  <span class="member">ReferenceCount</span> to 32 bits. </p>
  <p>In none of these early versions is the kernel known to treat this space as 
  having any bit flags. What they have instead are 12 bits of flags at offset 0x14 
  in combination with a Page Frame Number (PFN) in something like the style of a 
  Page Table Entry (PTE). This whole dword is here thought to be the original
  <span class="struct"><a href="../mmpfnentry.htm">MMPFNENTRY</a></span>. Version 
  4.0 moved the 12 bit flags to offset 0x0C and redefined the 20-bit
  <span class="member">PteFrame</span> as the whole integer. Concurrently, the 32-bit
  <span class="member">ReferenceCount</span> was narrowed to 16 bits, but now at 
  offset 0x0E. Though this might have been done as done as separate words for offsets 
  0x0C and 0x0E with no union in sight, keeping the bit flags in a 32-bit
  <span class="struct">MMPFNENTRY</span> is consistent with the
  <span class="member">u3</span> definition from the earliest public symbol files 
  and the simpler explanation is that this definition dates from version 4.0.

  <p>Originally, the <span class="member">e1</span> and <span class="member">e2</span> 
  branches each lay out the whole four bytes: <span class="member">e1</span> as 
  bit fields, leaving the reference count as a 16-bit <span class="member">DontUse</span> 
  field; <span class="member">e2</span> as 16-bit integers, collecting the flags 
  as <span class="member">ShortFlags</span> to be followed by the
  <span class="member">ReferenceCount</span>. Version 5.2 from Windows Server 2003 
  SP1 switched the flags and reference count, and changed many details of the construction.
  </p>
  <h4>Structure with Entry 1 </h4>
  <p>When the version 5.2 from Windows Server 2003 SP1 brought the 16-bit
  <span class="member">ReferenceCount</span> to the front of
  <span class="member">u3</span>, the <span class="struct">MMPFNENTRY</span> of
  <span class="type">ULONG</span> bit fields lost its high 16 bits that were labelled 
  as <span class="member">DontUse</span>, and was narrowed to <span class="type">
  USHORT</span> bit fields. Version 6.0 rearranged further into two sets of
  <span class="type">UCHAR</span> bit fields, which the 1607 release of Windows 
  10 formalises as separate structures <span class="struct">MMPFNENTRY1</span> and
  <span class="struct">MMPFNENTRY3</span>. </p>

  <h4>Entry 2 Structure </h4>
  <p>The <span class="member">e2</span> member is in essence a pair of 16-bit integers: 
  the 16 bits of flags that <span class="member">e1</span> defines as bit fields; 
  and a 16-bit reference count. The order changes and different versions put either 
  or both of the 16-bit integers in union with another that is
  <span class="keyword">volatile</span>. Starting with the 1607 release of Windows 
  10, the flags are all lost, leaving the <span class="member">e2</span> member 
  holding just the 16-bit <span class="member">ReferenceCount</span>. </p>
