<h1>LINK.EXE Command-Line Syntax </h1>
<p>Whether the linker runs as DUMPBIN, EDITBIN, LIB or LINK, its operation is controlled 
in the first instance by directives given as text, typically but not only on the 
command line. Directives are separated by white space, subject to
<a href="space.htm">enclosure of white space by double-quotes</a>. Three general 
categories are recognised: </p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="options.htm">options</a>, also called switches; </li>
  <li><a href="cmdfiles.htm">command-file directives</a>; </li>
  <li><a href="infiles.htm">input-file directives</a>. </li>
</ul>
<p>Options begin with a hyphen or forward slash. A command-file directive is an 
@ followed immediately by the name of a command file, whose text provides more directives. 
Any other directive names an input file, or files if the name contains wildcards.
</p>
<p>The linker gets these directives at first from what is in effect an extended 
command line drawn from several sources, in the following order: </p>
<ul>
  <li>the value of the <span class="env">LINK</span> environment variable (LINK 
  only); </li>
  <li>the actual command line, with command-file directives each expanded in place;
  </li>
  <li>the value of the <span class="env">_LINK_</span> environment variable (LINK 
  only). </li>
</ul>
<p>It is common, though not strictly correct, to talk of all the directives as command-line 
options, parameters, arguments, etc, even if the linker may in fact have picked 
them up from an environment variable or command file. It is the standard practice 
of these notes that references to the command line, unless qualified as the
<span class="emphasis">actual</span> command line, mean an effective command line 
composed as above. </p>
<p>Note that the <span class="env">LINK</span> and <span class="env">_LINK_</span> 
environment variables contribute to the command line only for LINK, not for DUMPBIN, 
EDITBIN or LIB. Note also that command-file directives are recognised only on the 
actual command line, not in environment variables and not recursively in command 
files. A command-file directive in these other sources is interpreted as an input-file 
directive, with the @ beginning the name of the input file. </p>
<p>Depending on what the linker is asked to do in directives given on the command 
line, it may later pick up more directives from object files. Only options are valid. 
Command-file and input-file directives cause fatal error 1276. Otherwise, the rules 
are much the same as for directives given on the command line. </p>
