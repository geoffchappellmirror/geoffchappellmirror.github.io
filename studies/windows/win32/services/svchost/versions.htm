<h1>SVCHOST Versions </h1>
<p>The SVCHOST.EXE program appears only in NT versions of Windows. It dates from 
Windows 2000, when it developed from code that was previously in SERVICES.EXE. It 
has progressed through minor versions for each new Windows package until a change 
of major version for Windows Vista. </p>

<p>This progression is mostly orderly, in the sense that support for a feature depends 
just on the major and minor version numbers, but there are exceptions, such that 
it can matter to know which build is being worked with. Some features start from 
a particular build number within a version, and are then supported in higher versions. 
Some have more complicated histories, where a feature is added for late builds of 
two versions, and is then supported in higher versions. </p>
<h2>Builds </h2>
<!--webbot bot="Include" U-Include="../../_include/builds.htm" TAG="BODY" startspan -->

<p>The following builds have been inspected for these notes. Most are from MSDN 
discs. Some, especially since Microsoft greatly reduced its shipment of operating 
systems on MSDN discs, are from service packs downloaded (typically as self-extracting 
executables) from a Microsoft website. </p>
<p>Builds are arranged in increasing order of the file version as recorded in the 
executable’s resources. This version number is readily visible using Windows Explorer 
either in a so-called infotip for the file or by accessing the Version tab in the 
Properties dialog for the file. Programmers know this version number as coming from 
the so-called root block of the version-information resource, specifically from 
the <span class="member">dwFileVersionMS</span> and <span class="member">dwFileVersionLS</span> 
members of a <span class="struct">VS_FIXEDFILEINFO</span> structure. </p>
<p>The date stamp shown for each version is more obscure. File dates are easily 
modified after the executable is built and are anyway liable to be shown differently 
when read from different time zones. However, there is in each executable’s header 
a date stamp which is set when the executable is built and which is not commonly 
changed afterwards. It is readily accessible to anyone with programming knowledge 
and appropriate tools, e.g., Microsoft’s own DUMPBIN utility. </p>

<p>There seems to be no SVCHOST.EXE in Windows 2000 Service Packs 1 to 4 inclusive. 
The binaries distributed with the original Windows XP and Service Pack 1 are identical.
