<h1>MLGetUILanguage </h1>
<p>This function gets the <a href="mui.htm">MUI language</a>. </p>
<h2>Declaration </h2>
<pre class="source">LANGID MLGetUILanguage (VOID);</pre>
<h3>Return Value </h3>
<p>The function returns the language ID for the MUI language. It returns 0 to indicate 
failure. </p>
<h2>Behaviour </h2>
<p>In the SHLWAPI version 6.00 from Windows Vista, this function is simply a jump 
to the standard API function <span class="function">GetThreadUILanguage</span>. 
This is at least a little odd. Inasmuch as the thread UI language is distinct in 
concept from the user default UI language and the system default UI language, it 
is never used by any other SHLWAPI code. In particular, it is never the language 
used by <span class="function"><a href="load.htm">MLLoadLibrary</a></span> when 
choosing which MUI satellite library to load. </p>
<h3>Earlier Versions </h3>
<p>In all earlier builds and versions, the function reliably returns the MUI language. 
This is the language that is in most cases the <span class="function">MLLoadLibrary</span> 
function’s first candidate for choosing the MUI satellite library. </p>
<h2>Availability </h2>
<p>The <span class="function">MLGetUILanguage</span> function is exported from SHLWAPI.DLL 
as ordinal 376 in version 5.00 and higher. </p>

<p>Though this function dates from as long ago as 1999, it was still not 
documented by Microsoft in the MSDN Library at least as late as the CD edition 
dated January 2004. </p>

<!--webbot bot="Include" i-checksum="43429" endspan -->
<p>Microsoft has documented the function since then, apparently during 2005 or 2006, 
as one of the many SHLWAPI Wrapper Functions. As yet another demonstration that 
Microsoft makes no serious effort, the function is mistakenly attached to Remarks 
about thread pools and timer queues, and the documentation in the Windows Vista 
Software Development Kit dated January 2007 still has the function forwarding to
<span class="function">GetUserDefaultUILanguage</span>. </p>
<p>The behaviour for versions from Windows XP and earlier is documented by Microsoft 
as steps 3, 4 and 2 for the procedure followed by <span class="function">MLLoadLibrary</span>.
