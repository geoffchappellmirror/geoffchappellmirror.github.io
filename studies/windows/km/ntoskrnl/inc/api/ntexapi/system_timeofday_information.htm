  <h1>SYSTEM_TIMEOFDAY_INFORMATION </h1>
  <p>The <span class="struct">SYSTEM_TIMEOFDAY_INFORMATION</span> structure (formally
  <span class="struct">_SYSTEM_TIMEOFDAY_INFORMATION</span> ) is what a successful 
  call to <span class="function"><a href="../../../api/ex/sysinfo/query.htm">ZwQuerySystemInformation</a></span> 
  or <span class="function">NtQuerySystemInformation</span> produces in its output 
  buffer when given the information class <span class="constant">SystemTmeOfDayInformation</span> 
  (0x03). </p>
  <h2>Documentation Status </h2>
  <p>The <span class="struct">SYSTEM_TIMEOFDAY_INFORMATION</span> structure is defined 
  in WINTERNL.H from the Software Development Kit (SDK). The definition there has 
  the whole structure as one array of bytes, named <span class="member">Reserved1</span>. 
  Documentation of <span class="function">NtQuerySystemInformation</span> describes 
  the structure as “opaque” and suggests that whatever is produced in it for the
  <span class="constant">SystemTimeOfDayInformation</span> case “can be used to 
  generate an unpredictable seed for a random number generator.” </p>
  <!--webbot bot="Include" U-Include="_include/true_definition.htm" TAG="BODY" startspan -->

<p>This note is instead concerned with what might reasonably be called the structure’s 
true definition. Since at least WIndows 8—and, for specificity, certainly in the 
original Windows 10—this definition that Microsoft itself works with is in an unpublished 
header named <a href="../../../source/inc/ntexapi.htm">ntexapi.h</a>. </p>

<!--webbot bot="Include" endspan i-checksum="24300" -->
  <!--webbot bot="Include" U-Include="../_include/type_info_urlmon.htm" TAG="BODY" startspan -->

<p>Microsoft does publish the practical equivalent of a C-language definition as 
type information in symbol files—not for the kernel, where the structure is prepared, 
nor even for low-level user-mode DLLs that interpret the structure, but for a handful 
of higher-level DLLs that might ordinarily be thought very distant from any involvement 
with the structure. Perhaps only by oversight, but starting as long ago as Windows 
8, Microsoft’s downloadable packages of public symbols have included a smattering 
of private symbol files and these continue to be available through the public symbol 
server. Precisely which DLLs have the type information varies between versions. 
COMBASE.DLL is among the more reliable nowadays. Disclosure in symbol files for 
URLMON.DLL stopped for the 1803 release of Windows 10 but is specially notable 
because of this DLL’s origins in Internet Explorer and thence for the strong suggestion 
that Microsoft’s programmers of Internet Explorer had access to more details of 
low-level Windows programming than Microsoft publishes for wider use (including 
by the programmers of competing web browsers). </p>

  <!--webbot bot="Include" U-Include="../_include/type_info_ddklibs.htm" TAG="BODY" startspan -->

<p>Type information for the structure has also seeped out at the other end of the 
Windows timeline, though not in symbol files but in statically linked libraries: 
GDISRVL.LIB from the Device Driver Kit (DDK) for Windows NT 3.51; and SHELL32.LIB 
from the DDK for Windows NT 4.0. </p>

  <h2>Layout </h2>
  <p>The <span class="struct">SYSTEM_TIMEOFDAY_INFORMATION</span> is the same in 
  both 32-bit and 64-bit Windows. The structure exists in two sizes: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>0x20 bytes in versions 3.10 to 4.0; </li>
    <li>0x30 bytes in versions 5.0 and higher. </li>
  </ul>
  <p>The structure has changed only by extension. The function originally requires 
  an output buffer that exactly fits the old structure. Starting from the structure’s 
  expansion, the function supports both the old and new structure in a notably liberal 
  way: it allows not just the old size and the new, but any size that is not larger 
  than the new. </p>

  <p>Not until Windows NT 4.0 SP4 did the kernel ensure that its preparation of 
  this structure on the stack (to copy to the caller’s output buffer) cleared the
  <span class="member">Reserved</span> space. </p>
  <p>What is here named the <span class="member">SleepTimeBias</span> is elsewhere 
  known as the <span class="member">InterruptTimeBias</span>, as for instance in 
  the <span class="struct"><a href="../ntexapi_x/kuser_shared_data/index.htm">KUSER_SHARED_DATA</a></span> 
  which is where the function loads this member from in version 6.0 and higher.
