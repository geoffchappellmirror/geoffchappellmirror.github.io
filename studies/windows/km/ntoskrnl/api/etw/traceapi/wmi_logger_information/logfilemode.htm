<h1>LogFileMode </h1>
<p>The key to the many options for configuring a tracing session, known informally 
as a logger, is a set of bit flags that are typically experienced in user mode as 
the <span class="member">LogFileMode</span> member of an <span class="struct">EVENT_TRACE_PROPERTIES</span> 
structure. Among the options is that a tracing session may have its buffers in user-mode 
memory, but if these are not specified, the tracing session is the kernel’s to start 
and manage. For communication to the kernel, nowadays through the
<span class="function"><a href="../control/index.htm">NtTraceControl</a></span> 
function, the session’s properties are repackaged as a <span class="struct">
<a href="index.htm">WMI_LOGGER_INFORMATION</a></span> structure, still with the 
bit flags as a <span class="type">ULONG</span> member named <span class="member">
LogFileMode</span>. This also is how the kernel presents the properties to itself 
for those sessions that it starts from <span class="regkey">AutoLogger</span> settings 
in the registry. This note is concerned solely with this kernel-mode interpretation 
of the <span class="member">LogFileMode</span> in the <span class="struct">WMI_LOGGER_INFORMATION</span> 
and the eventual retention of this LogFileMode as the <span class="member">LoggerMode</span> 
in the <span class="struct">
<a href="../../tracesup/wmi_logger_context/index.htm">WMI_LOGGER_CONTEXT</a></span>.
</p>
<p>Most of the log file modes are documented by Microsoft as
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/win32/etw/logging-mode-constants">Logging 
Mode Constants</a> and are defined as macros in EVNTRACE.H. Not all were documented 
immediately. For a few, Microsoft’s names are known only from the NTWMI.H header 
which Microsoft published in the Enterprise edition of the Windows Driver Kit (WDK) 
for Windows 10 version 1511. </p>
<p>In the following list of log file modes, the versions are those for which the 
flag is known to have some explicit recognition by the kernel, even if only to reject 
it as invalid. Where versions are not shown, the flag is not known to the kernel 
but may instead be vital to the separate NTDLL implementation that lets user-mode 
processes do their own event tracing. </p>

<h2>Validation </h2>
<p>Very many of the options are incompatible with other <span class="member">LogFileMode</span> 
flags and in some cases with other <span class="struct">WMI_LOGGER_INFORMATION</span> 
members. By incompatible is here meant that the combination prevents the tracing 
session from starting: <span class="function">NtTraceControl</span> fails, returning
<span class="constant">STATUS_INVALID_PARAMETER</span>. </p>
<p>The table for each flag shows the constraints that apply if the flag is set when 
trying to start a tracing session. These constraints are what the programmer (or 
the user who configures <span class="regkey">AutoLogger</span> settings) would need 
to know if thinking to use the flag. Note that many of these constraints were not 
enforced immediately that the flag was defined and many seem never to have been 
formally documented. </p>
<p>Less easily tabulated are the many requirements and inconsistencies that do not 
prevent a tracing session from starting but are instead corrected silently. When 
one flag requires another, the natural resolution of the other’s absence is to proceed 
as if the other had been set. The one is said (below) to imply the other. Where 
two flags are inconsistent, a resolution that stops short of treating them as incompatible 
is to accept one but proceed as if the other had been clear. The one is said to 
override the other. The terminology is in flux and perhaps never will be sorted 
out: if you don’t like it, please consider that Microsoft, who designed this as 
part of a product that makes money, is not known to have ever published any serious 
attempt. </p>

<p>Early documentation of <span class="constant">EVENT_TRACE_RELOG_MODE</span> was 
relatively expansive. Nowadays, documentation has it as “reserved for internal use”, 
and the whole technical content of what the option exists for is “Logs the event 
without including <span class="struct">EVENT_TRACE_HEADER</span>.” Once upon a time, 
Microsoft continued with </p>
<blockquote>
  The logger was started to re-log one or more existing log files to a new log file. 
  Therefore, the variable portion of the re-logged event already has a header from 
  the old log file.
</blockquote>
<p>The option evidently does something useful, just not something that Microsoft 
wants programmers writing for themselves. But that’s another story. The option only 
ever has been meaningful for user-mode tracing sessions. It’s unknown to the kernel 
until version 6.2 makes a point of rejecting it explicitly. </p>

<p>A tracing session that has kernel-mode buffers uses non-paged memory by default 
but can specify <span class="constant">EVENT_TRACE_USE_PAGED_MEMORY</span>. The 
buffers are then reserved in paged memory, of course. This is not suitable for kernel-mode 
event providers, which are free to write events when access to paged memory is forbidden. 
This is in general not a problem if such providers never are enabled for the session, 
but to specify <span class="constant">EVENT_TRACE_SYSTEM_LOGGER_MODE</span> is to 
want from the start that the kernel is an event provider and is ruled out. </p>
<p>Specifying <span class="constant">EVENT_TRACE_KD_FILTER_MODE</span> also declares 
an intention to receive events when paged memory may be out of bounds, but the resolution 
(also in version 6.2 and higher) is just that <span class="constant">EVENT_TRACE_USE_PAGED_MEMORY</span> 
is overridden. </p>

<p>Compression of buffers for writing to the log file dates from version 6.2 for 
tracing sessions that have user-mode buffers and are managed by NTDLL instead of 
the kernel. The compression functionality eventually gets some support for kernel-mode 
tracing sessions in the 1607 release of Windows 10. Until then, the kernel explicitly 
rejects <span class="constant">EVENT_TRACE_COMPRESSED_MODE</span> as invalid.
