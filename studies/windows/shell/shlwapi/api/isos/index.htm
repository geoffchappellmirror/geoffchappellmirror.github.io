<h1>Operating System Identification </h1>
<p>Microsoft’s own programmers have at least as much trouble as any with how 
their code may have to adapt its behaviour depending on what operating system it 
happens to get run on. Essential to this exercise is, of course, the means to 
identify the operating system and its key features or configurations. (No less 
important is to know what those key features are, and which variations of which 
operating systems have which features, but this is perhaps another story.) </p>
<p>It seems that after a few years of developing the 32-bit Windows shell, and 
certainly by the time Microsoft started integrating the shell and Internet 
Explorer, Microsoft’s programmers developed some stock code—indeed, it first 
appears in statically-linked libraries with names like STOCKLIB.LIB, STOCK4.LIB 
and STOCK5.LIB—for this work of answering standardised questions about the 
operating system. From version 5.00 of SHLWAPI.DLL onwards, this standard code 
is exported. There is just the one function:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><span class="doc04 function"><a href="isos.htm">IsOS</a></span> </li>
</ul>
<p>Curiously, SHLWAPI versions 5.00 up to but not including the version 6.00 
with Windows Vista carry two more or less identical copies, one exported, one 
not. Also, modules such as SHDOCVW.DLL retain (and use) their statically linked 
copies, yet also import the functionality from SHLWAPI. </p>
