  <h1>A Few Remarks On The Stuxnet Worm </h1>
  <p>Just when I had resigned myself to the notion that the computer security industry 
  doesn’t care to invest in reverse engineering, along comes the Stuxnet worm and 
  numerous investigations in which investment by each of any number of security 
  companies is apparently to be measured in man-months. Of course, reports that 
  have taken man-months would want to be detailed, and though I’m not shaken in 
  my belief that the greatest competition about reverse engineering in computer 
  security is not for the quality of the work but for the unsupported use of terms 
  such as “in-depth” and “comprehensive”, I must admit that a quick look at Stuxnet 
  confirmed that most of it surely had been mined at least well enough that I would 
  not find much to add except by committing to a full study. I’m biased, unsurprisingly, 
  but I think a substantial opportunity was missed by not having me on hand to have 
  got started on that in June or July. </p>
  <p>I can’t now catch up on others’ man-months, but within the constraints of what 
  I will do for free, I did find one perspective that seemed novel enough to justify 
  spending a little time to write up most of what I know about one Stuxnet component. 
  I think that although the kernel-mode driver MRXCLS.SYS seems only to have been 
  seen in Stuxnet, it was developed independently. Its code knows nothing of the 
  rest of Stuxnet. Indeed, <a href="mrxcls.htm">MRXCLS is a kernel-mode loader of 
  essentially arbitrary user-mode malware</a>. We should expect to see it again. 
  It might be prudent to look at whether early versions of it were used elsewhere, 
  and to look at what Stuxnet shows of an increasing specialisation in malware development.
  </p>
  <p>Before moving on, it occurred to me that although everyone surely has realised 
  that to talk of Stuxnet exploiting a vulnerability in .LNK files is to shoot the 
  messenger, someone ought to note it explicitly. The coding oversight that’s depended 
  on is actually that <a href="ctrlfldr.htm">the Control Panel may execute CPL modules 
  that aren’t currently installed</a>. Shortcut files just present the best
  <span class="emphasis">vector</span> for exploitation. You may think this is nit-picking, 
  but if we make a habit of not differentiating defects and vectors, then defects 
  may not be properly fixed and alternative vectors may go unexamined. The suggestion 
  is bad enough from Stuxnet that lax handling of PIDLs by shell folders makes for 
  a category of possible exploits that have mostly gone unnoticed or been neglected. 
  To get deflected by an inaccurate description of the exploited defect is to invite 
  a turn from bad to worse. </p>
  <p>By the way, there is something that’s natural for me but which I ought perhaps 
  make a point of telling you. Both the above articles about Stuxnet are derived 
  entirely from what reverse engineers in the security industry apparently refer 
  to as static analysis. I do not run malware any more than needed for getting it 
  unpacked. Everything you read here about Stuxnet is a wholly intellectual exercise, 
  with no experimental observation of Stuxnet executing, not even in any sort of 
  controlled environment. Though I’m pretty confident that what I read in the code 
  I read correctly, I’m not perfect and you should know that I have made no attempt 
  at all to verify by experiment anything that I have deduced. </p>
