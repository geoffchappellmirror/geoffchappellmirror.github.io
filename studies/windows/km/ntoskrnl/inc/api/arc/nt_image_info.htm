  <h1>NT_IMAGE_INFO </h1>
  <p>The <span class="struct">NT_IMAGE_INFO</span> structure (formally
  <span class="struct">_NT_IMAGE_INFO</span>) is the type of a variable named
  <span class="variable">NtImageInfo</span> which the Windows kernel exports in 
  the 1703 release of Windows 10 and higher. This variable is statically initialised, 
  such that its contents are meaningful even before the kernel executes. The variable 
  thus provides the boot loader, e.g., WINLOAD.EFI, with information about the kernel 
  that it has just loaded. If only in principle, the <span class="struct">NT_IMAGE_INFO</span> 
  might describe capabilities that the loader could adapt to in its preparation 
  for the kernel’s first execution, but the only use the loader yet makes of the 
  information is to decide whether the kernel fits the loader’s expectations well 
  enough that execution can proceed. </p>
  <p>At least to the 2004 release of Windows 10, the information in the
  <span class="struct">NT_IMAGE_INFO</span> comprises version numbers and the sizes 
  of important structures that the loader prepares for the kernel’s initialisation. 
  Because these structures are undocumented—not even given C-language definitions 
  in headers from contemporaneous editions of the Windows Driver Kit (WDK)—and the 
  memory that holds them is freed when the kernel completes its initialisation, 
  the suggestion is strong that the boot loader is the only intended importer of 
  the <span class="variable">NtImageInfo</span> variable and thus the only intended 
  interpreter of the <span class="struct">NT_IMAGE_INFO</span>. </p>
  <p>That said, the variable is not discarded and the <span class="struct">NT_IMAGE_INFO</span> 
  structure is not without value to kernel-mode software that seeks a programmatic 
  determination of the Windows version. Interfaces exist for obtaining the build 
  number, but this is not readily correlated with the roughly half-yearly updates 
  that Microsoft promotes as significant advances rather than mere updates. From 
  the <span class="struct">NT_IMAGE_INFO</span>, they can learn the NTDDI version 
  number from the kernel in contrast to repeatedly asking the
  <span class="function">RtlIsNtddiVersionAvailable</span> function whether the 
  kernel is at least some particular NTDDI version number. </p>
  <p>The <span class="struct">NT_IMAGE_INFO</span> is 0x18 bytes in both 32-bit 
  and 64-bit Windows, in all versions that are yet known to have it. The structure 
  is not documented. It is not defined in any header, nor even is it known from 
  public symbols. The structure’s name and the offsets and definitions of its members 
  are instead known from type information in the statically linked library CLFSMGMT.LIB 
  for the 1703 to 1903 releases of Windows 10. </p>

  <p>The <span class="member">Version</span> is presumably of the structure. The 
  only value yet observed for any kernel is 0. The <span class="member">OsMajorVersion</span> 
  and <span class="member">OsMinorVersion</span> look to be straightforwardly the 
  major and minor version numbers of Windows, which are notoriously unhelpful for 
  being 10 and 0 in all new releases of Windows for getting on to a decade. What 
  would once upon a time have counted as at least a service pack, if not a minor 
  version, is instead reported as the <span class="member">MajorRelease</span>. 
  This is an NTDDI version number as defined in the SDKDDKVER.H header. This version 
  number starts at 0x0A000003 for the 1703 release. It has been incremented for 
  all but one of the roughly bi-annual updates (the 1909 release being for all practical 
  effect a minor rebuild of the 1903 release). This brings it to 0x0A000008 for 
  the 2004 release, which is the last that is yet studied for this note. </p>
  <p>The <span class="member">LoaderBlockSize</span> and <span class="member">LoaderExtensionSize</span> 
  are respectively the sizes in bytes of the <span class="struct">
  <a href="loader_parameter_block.htm">LOADER_PARAMETER_BLOCK</a></span> and
  <span class="struct"><a href="loader_parameter_extension/index.htm">LOADER_PARAMETER_EXTENSION</a></span>.
