  <h1>Insufficient Free Disk Space for Printing </h1>
  <p>Print spooling is a technique for deferring the sending of data to a printer. 
  The intention is that the application program that initiated the print job can 
  get on with whatever other things it was designed to do rather than wait for the 
  communication of typically large amounts of data from the computer to the printer. 
  To make print spooling work, temporary files must be created to hold all the information 
  that is needed for the print job. From time to time and preferably when it has 
  the least impact on the user’s perceptions of the system’s performance, a process 
  that runs in the background reads information from the temporary files and sends 
  data to the printer, over and over until the job is done. </p>
  <h2>Problem </h2>
  <p>A print job may generate too much data to be stored in temporary files on whatever 
  drive (or drives) the print spooling system happens to be using for these temporary 
  files. The user is notified of the problem, but it is not obvious either: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>which drive the user should make sufficient free space on if the print job 
    is to succeed; </li>
    <li>or how the user may choose the location that the print spooling system uses 
    for temporary files. </li>
  </ul>
  <p>In Windows 95, the local directory that the print spooler uses for temporary 
  files is not configurable. Close inspection of the Microsoft Knowledge Base may 
  some day reveal an article in which Microsoft states this limitation and names 
  the preset directory. Without such information, users have little hope of divining 
  the best way forward if their print jobs fail due to insufficient free disk space.
  </p>
  <h2>Information </h2>
  <p>Windows 95 offers two forms of print spooling. In one, the information in the 
  temporary files is the raw data that is sent to the printer. In the other, each 
  temporary file is an enhanced metafile (EMF) that contains instructions for computing 
  raw data. These two methods are called RAW and EMF respectively. Knowledge of 
  these methods may help a user to get a print job completed on systems where sufficient 
  free space is not available at the location that the print spooler insists on.
  </p>
  <h3>Directory for Temporary Print Files </h3>
  <p>In both methods, the spooler creates shadow files (with the SHD extension) 
  and spooler files (with the SPL extension) in a particular directory. The local 
  directory that the Windows 95 Local Print Provider (implemented in SPOOLSS.DLL) 
  uses for these files is necessarily the SPOOL\PRINTERS subdirectory of the Windows 
  directory. This directory is the sole place that SPOOLSS looks for files with 
  the SHD and SPL extensions. The directory is not configurable. </p>
  <h4>Applicable Versions </h4>
  <p>The SPOOLSS version inspected for this note is from Windows 95. This note appears 
  to apply also to the version from Windows 98, and presumably also to intermediate 
  releases. Details such as file sizes, time stamps and known distribution packages 
  are given in the following table. </p>

  <h3>Raw Spooling </h3>
  <p>With raw spooling, each SPL file holds the raw data for the print job. These 
  SPL files must be in the SPOOL\PRINTERS subdirectory of the Windows directory. 
  The drive that contains the Windows directory must therefore have enough free 
  disk space for all the raw data that is to be sent to the printer as part of the 
  print job. Otherwise, printing fails. </p>
  <h3>EMF Spooling </h3>
  <p>If the user of a system configured for raw spooling cannot make sufficient 
  free space on the drive that holds the Windows directory, then it may still be 
  possible to print by reconfiguring for EMF spooling. </p>
  <p>An EMF may be considered as an intermediate stage in the generation of raw 
  data for the printer. The EMF method therefore defers not just the sending of 
  data to the printer but also some of the work involved in calculating what data 
  to send. This means that EMF spooling gives the advantage of a faster return to 
  the application that initiated the printing. Less work is done in the foreground. 
  More work is done in the background. The disadvantage is that each EMF is typically 
  larger than the raw printer data it corresponds to, so EMF spooling tends to require 
  more free disk space for the temporary files. </p>
  <p>With EMF spooling, each SPL file is a list of enhanced metafiles used for the 
  job. The SHD and SPL file for a print job are still necessarily in the SPOOL\PRINTERS 
  directory but they are typically small. In contrast, the possibly many metafiles 
  may have a large total size, usually much greater than the raw data that would 
  be stored as the SPL file for raw spooling, but they may be elsewhere, typically 
  in the directory given by the TEMP environment variable. </p>
  <p>Thus, users who are told that there is insufficient disk space for printing 
  may have some options. If they are using RAW spooling, then although a change 
  to EMF spooling will typically require more disk space overall for temporary print 
  files, the overwhelming bulk of data in these files can be configured to go to 
  some drive other than the one that holds the Windows directory. </p>
