  <h1>Interrupt 2Fh Function 1686h </h1>
  <p>This function tests whether the caller executes with protected-mode addressing 
  as a client of the DOS Protected Mode Interface (DPMI). Among the implications 
  of success is protected-mode interrupt handling and the availability of at least 
  some of the DPMI’s <span class="instruction">int 31h</span> functions. Testing 
  for these may be most of the reason that <span class="instruction">int 2Fh</span> 
  function 1686h exists. See especially that the subfunction number, 86h, is defined 
  symbolically as <span class="constant">W386_Test_Int31_Avail</span> in a header 
  named INT2FAPI.INC which Microsoft distributed with the Device Driver Kit at least 
  as early as for Windows 3.1. </p>
  <p>Among Microsoft’s DPMI hosts, <span class="instruction">int 2Fh</span> function 
  1686h is implemented by both DOSX and the Virtual Machine Manager (VMM) from Windows 
  3.0 and higher. </p>
  <h2>Parameters </h2>
  <p>The function uses registers for both input and output. </p>
  <h3>Input </h3>
  <table>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td><span class="register">ax</span> </td>
        <td>1686h </td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
  <h3>Success </h3>
  <table>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td><span class="register">ax</span> </td>
        <td>0000h </td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
  <h2>Behaviour </h2>
  <p>Success means not only that the calling program is a DPMI client in some general 
  sense but that this <span class="instruction">int 2Fh</span> in particular was 
  executed with protected-mode addressing and interrupt handling. If
  <span class="instruction">int 2Fh</span> function 1686h is instead executed with 
  real-mode addressing, e.g., before the DPMI client has stepped up to protected 
  mode with the help of <span class="instruction">int 2Fh</span> function 1687h 
  or during the real-mode or virtual-8086 handling of a DPMI client’s software interrupt, 
  then the function fails. </p>
  <p>DOSX distinguishes the cases by having separate <span class="instruction">int 
  2Fh</span> handling for protected mode and real mode. Executed in protected mode,
  <span class="instruction">int 2Fh</span> goes through the Interrupt Descriptor 
  Table (IDT). DOSX’s protected-mode handler recognises function 1686h and clears
  <span class="register">ax</span>. When executed in real mode, the processor diverts 
  the interrupt through the Interrupt Vector Table. DOSX’s real-mode hook passes 
  function 1686h along as unhandled. </p>
  <p>The VMM has common handling of <span class="instruction">int 2Fh</span> function 
  1686h in a V86 Interrupt Chain or as a PM Fault. This handling distinguishes the 
  interrupt’s origin according to the <span class="constant">VMSTAT_PM_EXEC</span> 
  flag in the <span class="member">CB_VM_Status</span> member of the Virtual Machine 
  Control Block (VMCB but formally a <span class="struct">cb_s</span>) for the current 
  VM. If the flag is set, the VMM returns the interrupt with
  <span class="register">ax</span> cleared. Otherwise, the interrupt is returned 
  with no registers changed. </p>
  <h2>Known Use </h2>
  <p>Microsoft’s only known caller of <span class="instruction">int 2Fh</span> function 
  1686h is SETUP.EXE from Windows 3.1 (explicitly not 3.0). What use SETUP makes 
  of the function has not yet been studied. </p>
  <h2>Missed Use </h2>
  <p>The DOSX from WIndows 3.0 has its own program loader for its child process 
  and starts this child’s execution in protected mode. The child is necessarily 
  KRNL286.EXE. The Windows 3.0 version of KRNL286 assumes it starts in protected 
  mode and has immediate use of <span class="instruction">int 31h</span> functions. 
  If instead it is executed as any ordinary DOS program, whether for mischief or 
  by accident but either way independently of DOSX, it crashes (with all the usual 
  potential for undefined behaviour from crashing DOS, all the way to hanging the 
  machine so that even Ctrl-Alt-Del does not reboot). Had Microsoft wanted to defend 
  against this, a check with <span class="instruction">int 2Fh</span> function 1686h 
  would have done nicely. </p>
