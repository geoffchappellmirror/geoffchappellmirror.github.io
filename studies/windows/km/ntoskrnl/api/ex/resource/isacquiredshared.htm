<h1>ExIsResourceAcquiredShared </h1>
<p>This function tests whether the current thread has acquired a given Executive 
Resource for either exclusive or shared access. </p>
<h2>Declaration </h2>
<pre class="source">BOOLEAN ExIsResourceAcquiredShared (ERESOURCE *Resource);</pre>
<h3>Parameters </h3>
<p>The <span class="argument">Resource</span> argument is the address of the
<span class="struct"><a href="eresource.htm">ERESOURCE</a></span> to test. </p>
<h3>Return Value </h3>
<p>The function returns the current thread’s acquisition count. This is the number 
of times the thread would have to release the resource (without reacquiring it) 
before losing access. If the current thread does not have access to the resource, 
whether exclusive or shared, then the function returns zero. </p>
<h2>Availability </h2>
<p>The <span class="function">ExIsResourceAcquiredShared</span> function is exported 
by name from the kernel in version 3.10 only. It is superseded in version 3.50 and 
higher by <span class="function"><a href="isacquiredsharedlite.htm">ExIsResourceAcquiredShareLite</a></span>.
</p>
<h2>Documentation Status </h2>
<p>The <span class="function">ExIsResourceAcquiredShared</span> function is nowadays 
documented—as obsolete, of course—but when it was not obsolete, it was not documented.
</p>
<p>Specifically, <span class="function">ExIsResourceAcquiredShared</span> is not 
documented in the Device Driver Kit (DDK) for Windows NT 3.1. For reasons unknown, 
it starts to be documented with the DDK for Windows Server 2003 SP1. Note that the 
return type as given in the documentation and reproduced above is incorrect—or, 
if you prefer, is correct only on the understanding that the <span class="type">
BOOLEAN</span> is not <span class="constant">TRUE</span> (1) or
<span class="constant">FALSE</span> but is non-zero or <span class="constant">FALSE</span>.
</p>
<p>The replacement in version 3.50 is documented from as long ago as the DDK for 
Windows NT 3.51. Since at least then, (a DDK for Windows NT 3.50 not having been 
found for reference), the <span class="function">ExIsResourceAcquiredShared</span> 
function is supported, presumably for rebuilding old code, by a macro that redefines 
the function as <span class="function">ExIsResourceAcquiredSharedLite</span>. Even 
this macro is long deprecated, starting with the DDK for Windows XP. </p>
<h2>Behaviour </h2>
<p>The <span class="function">ExIsResourceAcquiredShared</span> function examines 
the given resource’s table of owning threads and owner counts while holding the 
resource’s spin lock. If the current thread is in the table, the function returns 
the corresponding count, else it returns zero. </p>
<p>The resource’s table of owning threads and owner counts is for all owners, both 
shared and exclusive. To this function, exclusive ownership is a particular kind 
of shared ownership. </p>
<h3>IRQL </h3>
<p>The <span class="function">ExIsResourceAcquiredShared</span> function can be 
called at any IRQL up to and including <span class="constant">DISPATCH_LEVEL</span>. 
The <span class="argument">Resource</span> is assumed to be in non-paged memory.
