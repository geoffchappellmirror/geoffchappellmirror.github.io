<h1>Exports Added For KERNEL32 5.2 </h1>
<p>The table below lists all the functions that first appear as KERNEL32 exports 
in version 5.2, i.e., for Windows Server 2003. Very many are not exported from the 
original release of Windows Server 2003 but instead date from SP1, apparently to 
support 64-bit Windows. Indeed, many of these delayed additions are exported only 
from the x64 builds of version 5.2. Some are x64-only in later versions too. </p>
<p>Functions that appear to be undocumented are <span class="undocumented">highlighted 
yellow</span>. </p>
