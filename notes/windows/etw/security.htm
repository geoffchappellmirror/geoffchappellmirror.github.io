    <p>This old page from 2008 is now retired. Back then, this website had no place 
    for it except among these miscellaneous Notes. I anyway meant it only as a quick 
    write-up to stake an interest in a topic even if I never found cause to return 
    to it. As it happens, I have returned to this topic many times since but left 
    this page here, neglected. Now it is redone as

  <h1>Event Trace Security </h1>
  <p>Event providers and loggers are securable <span class="object">WmiGuid</span>

  <p>With one exception, each permission is also implied by one of
  <span class="constant">GENERIC_READ</span>, <span class="constant">GENERIC_WRITE</span> 
  and <span class="constant">GENERIC_EXECUTE</span>. Even <span class="constant">
  GENERIC_ALL</span> just combines the generic read, write and execute permissions, 
  and does not grant access to the NT Kernel Logger. </p>
  <h2>Registry Configuration </h2>
  <p>Permissions for particular loggers and providers are stored in the registry:
  </p>
  <table class="Registry">
    <tr>
      <td>Key: </td>
      <td><span class="regkey">HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\WMI\Security</span>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Value: </td>
      <td><span class="regvalue"><span class="placeholder">guid</span></span>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Type: </td>
      <td><span class="constant">REG_BINARY</span> </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  <p>where <span class="placeholder">guid</span> is the string form (without braces) 
  of a GUID that represents the provider or logger. The binary data is expected 
  to be a self-relative security descriptor. Let it be stressed that this means 
  a <span class="struct">SECURITY_DESCRIPTOR_RELATIVE</span> structure followed 
  by all the SIDs and ACLs that it refers to, not a string in the Security Descriptor 
  Definition Language (SDDL) such as used below. </p>
  <h3>Default Permissions </h3>
  <p>The special value <span class="regvalue">0811c1af-7a07-4a06-82ed-869455cdf713</span> 
  represents all objects that do not have their own permissions. It is defined symbolically 
  as <span class="symbol">DefaultTraceSecurityGuid</span> in EVNTRACE.H from the 
  Windows SDK, but seems to be otherwise undocumented. Windows Vista is installed 
  with the following security descriptor as this default: </p>
  <p>O:BAG:BA:(A;;0x0800;;;WD)(A;;0x00120FFF;;;SY)(A;;0x00120FFF;;;LS)(A;;0x00120FFF;;;NS)(A;;0x00120FFF;;;BA)(A;;0x0EE5;;;S-1-5-559)
  </p>
  <p>It may help to have the corresponding access rights described in terms of symbolic 
  constants from the Windows SDK: </p>
  <table>
    <tr>
      <th>User or Group </th>
      <th>Rights </th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>SYSTEM <br>
      LOCAL SERVICE <br>
      NETWORK SERVICE <br>
      Administrators </td>
      <td><span class="constant">WMIGUID_ALL_ACCESS</span> </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Performance Log Users </td>
      <td><span class="constant">WMIGUID_QUERY</span> <br>
      <span class="constant">WMIGUID_NOTIFICATION</span> <br>
      <span class="constant">TRACELOG_CREATE_REALTIME</span> <br>
      <span class="constant">TRACELOG_CREATE_ONDISK</span> <br>
      <span class="constant">TRACELOG_GUID_ENABLE</span> <br>
      <span class="constant">TRACELOG_LOG_EVENT</span> <br>
      <span class="constant">TRACELOG_ACCESS_REALTIME</span> <br>
      <span class="constant">TRACELOG_REGISTER_GUIDS</span> </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Everyone </td>
      <td><span class="constant">TRACELOG_REGISTER_GUIDS</span> </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  <p>These default permissions are presumably what Microsoft’s documentation has 
  in mind when talking of Performance Log Users being able to control sessions. 
  Note that although members of the Performance Log Users group have most of the 
  defined permissions, they lack <span class="constant">WMIGUID_SET</span>,
  <span class="constant">WMIGUID_READ_DESCRIPTION</span>, <span class="constant">
  WMIGUID_EXECUTE</span> and <span class="constant">TRACELOG_ACCESS_KERNEL_LOGGER</span>.
  </p>
  <h4>WMI Default </h4>
  <p>If a valid security descriptor is not set for the <span class="regvalue">0811c1af-7a07-4a06-82ed-869455cdf713</span> 
  value, the kernel falls back to the built-in WMI default: </p>
  <p>O:BAG:BAD:(A;;0x001FFFFF;;;SY)(A;;0x0800;;;BU)(A;;0x011FFFFF;;;BA)(A;;0x001FFFFF;;;LS)(A;;0x001FFFFF;;;NS)
  </p>
  <p>Note that this provides no middle ground between having all access and nearly 
  none: </p>
  <table>
    <tr>
      <th>User or Group </th>
      <th>Rights </th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Administrators </td>
      <td><span class="constant">SPECIFIC_RIGHTS_ALL</span> <br>
      <span class="constant">STANDARD_RIGHTS_ALL</span> <br>
      <span class="constant">ACCESS_SYSTEM_SECURITY</span> </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>SYSTEM <br>
      LOCAL SERVICE <br>
      NETWORK SERVICE </td>
      <td><span class="constant">SPECIFIC_RIGHTS_ALL</span> <br>
      <span class="constant">STANDARD_RIGHTS_ALL</span> </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Users </td>
      <td><span class="constant">TRACELOG_REGISTER_GUIDS</span> </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  <p>Both the installed default and the built-in default extend full control not 
  just to the SYSTEM account and to Administrators but also to the LOCAL SERVICE 
  and NETWORK SERVICE accounts. The security descriptors installed for some providers 
  do not permit any access to anyone other than Administrators and the SYSTEM account. 
  This shuts out the Eventlog service, which runs as LOCAL SERVICE in Windows Vista. 
  A consequence in practice is that even a user with administrative privilege will 
  encounter an error if trying to enable these providers through either the Event 
  Viewer or the WEVTUTIL command-line tool, or through any tool that uses the Windows 
  Event Log functions (such as <span class="function">EvtSaveChannelConfig</span>). 
  Whether this is intended is not known. A ready example is the
  <a href="../../../studies/windows/win32/services/scm/events/diagnostic.htm">Microsoft 
  Windows Services Performance Diagnostic Provider</a>. </p>
  <h2>Programmatic Support </h2>
  <p>WMI security can be managed programmatically through ADVAPI32 functions
  <span class="function">EventAccessControl</span>, <span class="function">EventAccessQuery</span> 
  and <span class="function">EventAccessRemove</span>, which are all documented. 
  The last two operate directly on the relevant registry value, but the first works 
  through the lower-level functions <span class="function">GetNamedSecurityInfo</span> 
  and <span class="function">SetNamedSecurityInfo</span>. </p>
  <p>A quirk should be noted. For a GUID that is registered,
  <span class="function">EventAccessQuery</span> and <span class="function">GetNamedSecurityInfo</span> 
  produce the same security descriptor. If a GUID happens not to be registered, 
  then <span class="function">EventAccessQuery</span> fails (returning
  <span class="constant">ERROR_FILE_NOT_FOUND</span>) but <span class="function">
  GetNamedSecurityInfo</span> produces the WMI default. This will typically not 
  be the security descriptor that the kernel will apply if the GUID is used for 
  Event Tracing. For that, ask <span class="function">EventAccessQuery</span> about 
  the <span class="symbol">DefaultTraceSecurityGuid</span>. </p>
  <h2>User-Interface Support </h2>
  <p>The Reliability and Performance Monitor has a user interface for viewing and 
  changing the security settings for providers and loggers. This tool is typically 
  run as a Microsoft Management Console snap-in from the Administrative Tools menu. 
  Among its Data Collector Sets are two sets of trace sessions. The Event Trace 
  Sessions are all the loggers that are already started (well, all that are reported 
  by the <span class="function">QueryAllTraces</span> function). The folder named 
  Startup Event Trace Sessions lists the loggers that are configured as AutoLoggers. 
  The Properties dialog for any of these loggers lists the relevant providers and 
  lets you manage security for each provider (via a Security button on the Trace 
  Providers tab) and for the logger itself (via the Security tab). </p>
  <p>This user interface is all I have found in the standard Windows package but 
  surely cannot be all that Microsoft has coded. It has two significant defects.
  </p>
  <p>First, it is not general. It does not let you browse the installed providers 
  for their security settings before they are assigned to a logger. Neither does 
  it let you browse the known loggers, such as shown in the Event Viewer. Though 
  you can define a logger and assign providers to it, and set security for this 
  logger and its providers, only by careful contrivance will your logger match one 
  whose output you expect to see through the Event Viewer. There is perhaps an opportunity 
  here for some third-party manufacturer of low-level maintenance gadgets. </p>
  <p>Second, and this really is a coding error that may even make the interface 
  unsafe to use, it misses two of the applicable permissions, namely
  <span class="constant">WMIGUID_QUERY</span> and <span class="constant">TRACELOG_REGISTER_GUIDS</span>. 
  Where WDC.DLL tells ACLUI.DLL about the specific access rights that are available 
  for these securable objects, its tables simply omit these two. This oversight 
  persists at least to Windows Vista SP1. Where Windows Vista is reported to have 
  problems of mass-market acceptance because of its focus on security, it ought 
  at least be observed that some of what Microsoft has done about security is only 
  half-baked. </p>
