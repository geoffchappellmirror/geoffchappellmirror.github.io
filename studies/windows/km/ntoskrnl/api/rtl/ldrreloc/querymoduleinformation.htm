  <h1>RtlQueryModuleInformation </h1>
  <p>The <span class="function">RtlQueryModuleInformation</span> function produces 
  an array of one or another sort of structure for each of the loaded kernel-mode 
  modules. </p>
  <h2>Declaration </h2>
  <pre class="source">NTSTATUS 
RtlQueryModuleInformation (
    ULONG *InformationLength, 
    ULONG SizePerModule, 
    PVOID InformationBuffer);</pre>
  <p>Names and types for the arguments in the preceding declaration are confected 
  for this article, Microsoft’s being unknown. </p>
  <h3>Parameters </h3>
  <p>The <span class="argument">InformationLength</span> argument provides the address 
  of a variable that may matter for both input and output. On input, the variable 
  provides the size, in bytes, of the buffer that is to receive the module information. 
  This size is ignored if no buffer is provided, i.e., if <span class="argument">
  InformationBuffer</span> is <span class="constant">NULL</span>. On output, the 
  variable tells how much information, in bytes, the successful function has put 
  into the buffer or may tell how much the failed function might have put into the 
  buffer (had the buffer been large enough). </p>
  <p>The <span class="argument">SizePerModule</span> argument selects the type of 
  information that is sought. It is specifically the size, in bytes, of the structure 
  that the function is to produce for each loaded module. The supported structures 
  are <span class="struct">
  <a href="../../../inc/api/ntldr/rtl_module_basic_info.htm">RTL_MODULE_BASIC_INFO</a></span> 
  and <span class="struct">
  <a href="../../../inc/api/ntldr/rtl_module_extended_info.htm">RTL_MODULE_EXTENDED_INFO</a></span>.
  </p>
  <p>The <span class="argument">InformationBuffer</span> argument provides the address 
  of the buffer that is to receive information about the loaded modules. This argument 
  can be <span class="constant">NULL</span> to mean that there is no buffer (and 
  the module information is not wanted but the size is). </p>
  <h3>Return Value </h3>
  <p>The function returns <span class="constant">STATUS_SUCCESS</span> if successful, 
  else a negative error code. </p>
  <p>Of particular importance are the cases in which module information might be 
  provided but is too large for the given buffer, including because there is no 
  buffer. If <span class="argument">InformationBuffer</span> is
  <span class="constant">NULL</span>, then because the caller did not ask for module 
  information and is not denied anything that was asked for, the function succeeds. 
  If <span class="argument">InformationBuffer</span> is not
  <span class="constant">NULL</span>, the caller asked for module information which 
  the function cannot deliver, and the function therefore fails, returning
  <span class="constant">STATUS_BUFFER_TOO_SMALL</span>. Either way, a size that 
  would have sufficed will have been set into the variable at the address given 
  by <span class="argument">InformationLength</span>. </p>
  <p>Be aware that a size that would have sufficed on one call to the function need 
  not still suffice on another, no matter how soon. This is not just the usual theoretical 
  point, but a practical one: kernel-mode modules get loaded and unloaded, such 
  that a change in their number between calls is, if not actually likely, then at 
  least unsurprising. </p>
  <h2>Availability </h2>
  <p>The <span class="function">RtlQueryModuleInformation</span> is exported by 
  name from both the kernel and NTDLL in version 6.0 and higher. A function with 
  the same name is exported by name from NTDLL in version 3.10 only, but it is very 
  different and is left for another time. </p>
  <h2>Documentation Status </h2>
  <p>The <span class="function">RtlQueryModuleInformation</span> is not documented.
  </p>
  <h2>Behaviour </h2>
  <p>If <span class="argument">SizePerModule</span> is not the size of either supported 
  structure, the function fails, returning <span class="constant">STATUS_INVALID_PARAMETER_2</span>. 
  If the <span class="argument">InformationBuffer</span> is not suitably aligned 
  for the supported structures, the function fails, returning
  <span class="constant">STATUS_INVALID_PARAMETER_3</span>. </p>
  <p>The function extracts the desired module information from more detailed data 
  that it obtains through the <span class="constant">SystemModuleInformation</span> 
  case of <span class="function"><a href="../../ex/sysinfo/query.htm">ZwQuerySystemInformation</a></span>, 
  first with a minimal buffer on the stack. If no information buffer is provided, 
  the function calls <span class="function">ZwQuerySystemInformation</span> just 
  the once, to learn how many modules are loaded and to calculate how large an information 
  buffer the caller would have sufficed for successful extraction. More typically, 
  the function calls <span class="function">ZwQuerySystemInformation</span> again 
  but with a dynamically allocated buffer, repeating with larger buffers until the 
  called function succeeds. Failure of the called function for any reason other 
  than needing a larger buffer is failure for <span class="function">RtlQueryModuleInformation</span>. 
  If the function fails to get an indicated amount of memory for this buffer, it 
  fails, returning <span class="constant">STATUS_INSUFFICIENT_RESOURCES</span>.
  </p>
  <p>When <span class="function">ZwQuerySystemInformation</span> succeeds, the function 
  learns how many modules are loaded and how much module information it might put 
  in the given buffer. If the given buffer is large enough, the function extracts 
  the wanted information. Otherwise it fails, returning <span class="constant">STATUS_BUFFER_TOO_SMALL</span>. 
  Either way, the variable at <span class="argument">InformationLength</span> receives 
  the size. </p>
