  <h1>Run-Time Bug Fix for WDEB386 Version 4.0.4 </h1>
  <p>The WDEB386 debugger supplied with the Windows 95 DDK has some problems, both 
  when running Windows 95 and especially when running earlier Windows versions.
  </p>
  <h2>Problems </h2>
  <p>Supose the debugger is run from a DOS command prompt to start Windows 95 and 
  is given its <span class="switch">/h</span> switch. Then when the Windows session 
  is shut down, i.e., when Windows exits to DOS, the debugger falls over, executing 
  essentially random code. This is unfortunate because it defeats a Windows 95 feature 
  that programmers could otherwise use to shorten the cycle of writing and testing.
  </p>
  <p>The debugger does not work properly when running earlier versions of Windows. 
  Most noticeable is the inability to break into the debugger by using either Ctrl-C 
  at the terminal or Ctrl-Alt-SysRq on the test machine’s keyboard. This is inconvenient 
  for programmers who want to test that code written primarily for Windows 95 will 
  work as expected when run under earlier Windows versions. </p>
  <p>The debugger has some attractive features that do not rely for their existence 
  on anything new to Windows 95 but which are nonetheless not available when the 
  debugger runs earlier versions of Windows. Among these features is the support 
  for debugging via screen-switching instead of through a serial port. </p>
  <h2>Remedy </h2>
  <p>All three of the problems sketched above are rectifiable from a small DOS program. 
  The idea is to place a WDEB386.COM program in the same directory as the WDEB386.EXE 
  program supplied with the Windows 95 DDK. Thereafter, when running the debugger 
  from a DOS command line prompt before starting Windows, the WDEB386.COM will run 
  first and fix some bugs in WDEB386.EXE at run-time. Running WDEB386.COM does not 
  modify the WDEB386.EXE file on disk. It works by hooking int 21h and modifying 
  the image in memory before and during execution. </p>
  <p>Source code for this WDEB386.COM is all in assembly language, with comments 
  to describe the bugs that are addressed, and what is to be done about them. Some 
  of the headers are from the diskette included with <span class="citation">DOS 
  Internals</span> (ISBN 0-201-60835-9), and therefore date from as early as 1991. 
  The program itself was written in 1996. I do not recall updating it for later 
  WDEB386 versions. </p>
  <p>For distribution, the built program and its source code are compressed into 
  a zip file: click here to <a href="_download/wdeb386.zip">download the bug fix
