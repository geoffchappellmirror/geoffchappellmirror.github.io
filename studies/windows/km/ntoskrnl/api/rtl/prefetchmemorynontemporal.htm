<h1>RtlPrefetchMemoryNonTemporal </h1>
<p>This function suggests to the processor that specified memory be moved into the 
processor’s cache in anticipation of Non Temporal Access (NTA). </p>
<h2>Declaration </h2>
<pre>VOID
FASTCALL
RtlPrefetchMemoryNonTemporal (
    PVOID Source,
    SIZE_T Length);</pre>
<h2>Behaviour </h2>
<p>If activated for non-trivial behaviour, the <span class="function">RtlPrefetchMemoryNonTemporal</span> 
function feeds successive addresses in the given buffer to the
<span class="instruction">prefetchnta</span> instruction, advancing each time by 
the number of bytes that has been determined as the Prefetch NTA Granularity. For 
the 32-bit kernel, the granularity is 32 bytes by default but is overrridden if 
suitable <a href="../../../cpu/l2cache.htm">second-level cache support</a> is discovered 
when initialising the kernel for a processor. For the 64-bit kernel, the granularity 
is hard-coded as 64 bytes. </p>
<p>In 32-bit versions before 6.2, <span class="function">RtlPrefetchMemoryNonTemporal</span> 
is initially trivial. Its first instruction is a <span class="instruction">ret</span>. 
If all processors support the <span class="bit">FXSR</span> and
<span class="bit">SSE</span> features, the kernel activates the function by patching 
the <span class="instruction">ret</span> to a <span class="instruction">nop</span>. 
Later versions do not play at this, since both these CPU features are sure to be 
present: without them, the kernel would have stopped, raising the bug check
<span class="constant"><a href="../../../bugchecks/5d.htm">UNSUPPORTED_PROCESSOR</a></span> 
(0x5D). As an aside, note that the kernel goes to no special trouble to patch itself: 
the kernel’s executable image, even pages that contain only code, is writable.
</p>
<h2>Availability </h2>
<p>The <span class="function">RtlPrefetchMemoryNonTemporal</span> function is exported 
by name from the Windows kernel in the build of version 5.0 from Windows 2000 SP3, 
and higher. </p>
<p>The function is in the kernel’s <span class="section">.text</span> section and 
is therefore not liable to be paged out. Indeed, it is callable at any IRQL. </p>
<h3>Documentation Status </h3>
<p>The function is documented, but was not immediately so. It is not mentioned in 
documentation from any known Device Driver Kit (DDK) for Windows XP or Windows Server 
2003, though it is declared in NTDDK.H from these kits. Documentation in the Windows 
Driver Kit (WDK) for Windows Vista states explicitly that the function is “available 
in Windows Server 2003 and later versions of Windows”, though the C-language declaration, 
now in WDM.H, allows it if targetting Windows 2000 SP3. </p>
<p>Not only does the kernel from Windows 2000 SP3 export the function, it also is 
the first to try determining the NTA granularity by executing the
<span class="instruction">cpuid</span> instruction, specifically to recognise that 
some GenuineIntel processors have NTA granularity of 64 or 128 bytes. Microsoft 
is not known to use the function until Windows XP, so that TCPIP.SYS can prefetch 
addresses for a receive buffer. </p>
