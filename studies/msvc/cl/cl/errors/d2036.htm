<h1>CL Command-Line Error D2036 </h1>
<h2>Message Text </h2>
<pre class="output">&#39;/<span class="placeholder">option</span>&#39; not allowed with multiple source files</pre>
<!--webbot bot="Include" U-Include="_include/stderr.htm" TAG="BODY" startspan -->

<p>This error message is written to whatever file or device was given to CL as 
standard error. It is therefore not subject to simple redirection from the 
Command Prompt, e.g., for capture to a file. </p>

<!--webbot bot="Include" i-checksum="58325" endspan -->
<h2>Circumstances </h2>
<p>This error occurs when CL is given at least two compilable
<a href="../infiles.htm">input files</a> and one of the following options: </p>
<ul>
  <li><span class="switch"><a href="../options/zx.htm">/ZX</a></span> with any argument
  </li>
  <li><span class="switch"><a href="../options/f$a.htm">/Fa</a></span>,
  <span class="switch"><a href="../options/f$c.htm">/Fc</a></span>,
  <span class="switch"><a href="../options/f$l.htm">/Fl</a></span>,
  <span class="switch"><a href="../options/f$o.htm">/Fo</a></span>,
  <span class="switch"><a href="../options/fr.htm">/FR</a></span> or
  <span class="switch"><a href="../options/f$r.htm">/Fr</a></span> with an argument 
  that allows for only one output file. </li>
</ul>
<p>The message text shows the offending <span class="switch">/</span><span class="placeholder">option</span> 
with its argument. </p>
<h3>Example </h3>
<p>The command </p>
<pre class="input">cl /c /Fatest.asm test1.cpp test2.cpp</pre>
<p>is typical. The <span class="switch">/Fa</span> option directs that an assembly-language 
listing file be created as a by-product of compiling each C or C++ source file. 
Since the two input files to the command are both compilable, there are two listing 
files to produce. However, the <span class="switch">/Fa</span> option is given with 
the syntax that names only one listing file, hence error D2036. </p>
<h3>Coding Error </h3>
<p>Ordinarily, the compilable input files are C and C++ source files, in the sense 
of CL recognising them as having a front-end or back-end C or C++ compiler among 
the applicable <a href="../../modules.htm">compiler modules</a>. What counts as 
a compilable input file for this error is not necessarily the same. The difference 
may mean on the one hand that the error occurs when not actually needed, and on 
the other that the error does not occur even though it ought. </p>
<p>For the purpose of this error, as actually coded, an input file counts as compilable 
if it is either </p>
<ul>
  <li>named in its own command-line token, with the file extension of a C or C++ 
  source file </li>
  <li>named as a C or C++ source file through a <span class="switch">
  <a href="../options/t$c.htm">/Tc</a></span> or <span class="switch">
  <a href="../options/t$p.htm">/Tp</a></span> option </li>
</ul>
<p>Note that an input file counts for error D2036 if it is named in its own command-line 
token, with the file extension of a C or C++ source file, even if a
<span class="switch"><a href="../options/to.htm">/TO</a></span> option causes CL 
to treat the file as an object file. </p>
<p>Conversely, an input file that is named in its own command-line token, does not 
have the file extension of a C or C++ source file, but gets compiled as a C or C++ 
source file because of a <span class="switch"><a href="../options/tc.htm">/TC</a></span> 
or <span class="switch"><a href="../options/tp.htm">/TP</a></span> option, does 
not count for error D2036. More exotically, neither does an input file count for 
this error if it is named in its own command-line token with an unrecognised file 
extension but is compiled (well, preprocessed) as a C source file because of a
<span class="switch"><a href="../options/e.htm">/E</a></span> or
<span class="switch"><a href="../options/ep.htm">/EP</a></span> option. </p>
<h4>Examples </h4>
<p>In the admittedly contrived command </p>
<pre class="input">cl /Fatest.asm /TO /Tptest1.c test2.cpp</pre>
<p>the first input file has the extension of a C source file but is to be compiled 
as a C++ source file, because it is named through <span class="switch">/Tp</span>, 
and the second input file has the extension of a C++ source file but is to be treated 
as an object file, because of the <span class="switch">/TO</span>. The command therefore 
has only one input file to compile, but terminates with error D2036 because CL counts 
both the input files as C++ source files without allowing that this identification 
will change because of the <span class="switch">/TO</span>. </p>
<p>For an example of the converse, consider the following command </p>
<pre class="input">cl /Fatest.asm /TP test1.c test2.h</pre>
<p>Because of the <span class="switch">/TP</span>, the command has two C++ source 
files to compile. The command therefore has two assembly-language listing files 
to create in response to the <span class="switch">/Fa</span>, but only one name 
for them. Yet error D2036 is avoided, because although the first input file counts 
as compilable for causing the error, the second does not. </p>
<h2>Documentation Status </h2>
<p>Where the product documentation lists the applicable options, it omits the options 
that the product documentation anyway doesn’t document, i.e.,
<span class="switch">/Fc</span>, <span class="switch">/Fl</span> and
<span class="switch">/ZX</span>. </p>
