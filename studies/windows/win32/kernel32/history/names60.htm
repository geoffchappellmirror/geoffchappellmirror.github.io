<h1>Exports Added For KERNEL32 6.0 </h1>
<p>The table below lists all the functions that first appear as KERNEL32 exports 
in version 6.0, i.e., for Windows Vista. </p>
<p>Functions that appear to be completely undocumented are
<span class="undocumented">highlighted yellow</span>. A few of these new functions 
were not documented immediately, and are <span class="delayed">shaded pink</span>. 
They are marked below as “undocumented until 2009” since the first SDK that is known 
to document these functions is the one for Windows 7, released in August 2009. </p>
