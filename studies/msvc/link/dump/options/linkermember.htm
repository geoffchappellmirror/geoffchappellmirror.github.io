<h1>DUMPBIN /LINKERMEMBER </h1>
<p>This option directs that DUMPBIN describe the linker members of library 
files.
</p>
<h2>Syntax </h2>
<blockquote>
  <p><span class="switch">/linkermember</span>[<span class="switch">:</span><span class="placeholder">flags</span>]<span class="switch">
  </span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is a fatal error (LNK1147) if <span class="placeholder">flags</span> is 
not a number. The default for <span class="placeholder">flags</span> is 3. </p>
<h2>Behaviour </h2>
<p>This option applies only to libraries. The linker members of an archive are 
the first member and as many as two more. The first linker member lists the 
archive’s public symbols and gives for each the file offset to the object-file 
member that defines the symbol. The second linker member lists the file offsets 
for each of the archive’s object-file members, then lists the public symbols and 
gives for each the 1-based index of the object-file member that defines the 
symbol. The third linker member provides storage for long names of object-file 
members. </p>
<p>Set the 0x01 bit in <span class="placeholder">flags</span> to have the first 
linker member be dumped. Set the 0x02 bit in <span class="placeholder">flags</span> 
to have the second and third be dumped when present. Other
<span class="placeholder">flags</span> bits are recorded without complaint but 
are not meaningful. The set bits accumulate from multiple <span class="switch">
/linkermember</span> 
options. </p>
<p>For all three linker members, DUMPBIN describes the member header. This 
description is the same as produced for the headers of object-file members if 
the
<span class="switch"><a href="archivemembers.htm">/archivemembers</a></span> 
option is enabled. For the first and second linker members, DUMPBIN also reports 
what follows the header. Thus, it displays the public symbols, plus the offsets 
and indices (if applicable) of the object-file members that define those 
symbols. The public symbols are presented in whatever order they appear in the 
relevant linker member. </p>
