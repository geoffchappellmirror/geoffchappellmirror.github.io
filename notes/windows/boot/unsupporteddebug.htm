  <h1>Get More from the Windows Boot Menu </h1>
  <p>Windows XP and its predecessors have long offered a text-mode menu for selecting 
  which operating system to boot. The available operating systems are learnt from 
  entries in the BOOT.INI file. Each entry provides a title, a path and options. 
  The menu ordinarily shows only the titles. Provision exists, however, to reveal 
  extra detail in the boot menu and even to edit the selected operating system’s 
  options before proceeding with the boot. As so often, Microsoft seems to have 
  left this potentially useful facility undocumented. </p>
  <h2>Background </h2>
  <p>When booting a machine on which a Windows NT version is installed (prior to 
  Windows Vista), the NT bootstrap loader (NTLDR) may offer a text-mode menu of 
  installed operating systems and of configurations in which to start them. The 
  possibilities are learnt from entries in the <span class="inisect">[operating 
  systems]</span> section of a BOOT.INI file. Each entry takes one line of the file 
  and can provide a title, a path and options. </p>
  <p>The menu lists the operating systems by their titles, one per line. One title 
  is displayed in reverse video as a highlight to denote that it is the current 
  selection. The user changes the current selection by pressing the Up, Down, Home 
  and End keys, and accepts the current selection by pressing Enter (or by letting 
  a configurable timeout expire). </p>
  <p>The menu ordinarily shows nothing of the path or options for any operating 
  system, except that some few options of special significance to the loader are 
  indicated indirectly by appending to the title a qualifying description (such 
  as “debugger enabled”) in square brackets. </p>
  <h2>Enhancements </h2>
  <p>NTLDR has two undocumented enhancements of the boot menu. One is an action 
  to take at boot time to reveal the path and options. The other, which (unfortunately) 
  requires advance preparation, is to allow editing of the options before proceeding 
  with the boot. </p>
  <h3>Show Path and Options </h3>
  <p>To be shown the path and options for the installed operating systems, type
  <span class="keyword">unsupporteddebug</span> while the menu is displayed. Your 
  typing will be blind: there is no feedback on the display until you have pressed 
  all the necessary keys. The result is a new display area beneath the list of available 
  operating systems. The title, path and options for the current selection are shown 
  there, and are updated whenever the current selection changes. </p>
  <h4>Warning </h4>
  <p>Once you put the boot menu into this unsupported debug mode, be careful about 
  pressing F5 or F8. These keys take you to the Windows Advanced Options Menu, as 
  usual, but if you cancel this menu, thinking to return to the boot menu, you will 
  trigger a coding error. The consequences vary with the NTLDR version, depending 
  on the precise arrangement of local variables on the stack. When the boot menu 
  is redrawn, the text at the top may be corrupt or the NTLDR may crash. </p>
  <h3>Edit Options </h3>
  <p>As well as letting you see the title, path and options for each of the installed 
  operating systems, your blind typing of <span class="keyword">unsupporteddebug</span> 
  may allow you to edit the options for whatever operating system you eventually 
  choose to start. If BOOT.INI has been prepared in advance so that at least one 
  entry in the <span class="inisect">[operating systems]</span> section satisfies 
  at least one of four properties (listed below, under the heading Restriction), 
  then when you accept the current selection from the menu, the loader will clear 
  the display, show the title, path and options for the selected system, and prompt 
  you to “Enter new load options”. </p>
  <p>Editing is basic, as if in overwrite mode with no facility to toggle to an 
  insert mode. A cursor is simulated by showing one character in reverse video. 
  The Left, Right, Home and End keys move the cursor. Keys that correspond to an 
  ASCII character between space and the lower-case z cause that character to overwrite 
  whatever character was already at the cursor. The Insert key inserts one space 
  at the cursor, so that each character at and to the right of the cursor moves 
  one column further right. The Delete key deletes the character at the cursor, 
  so that each character to the right of the cursor moves one column left. The Backspace 
  key deletes the character to the left of the cursor, so that each character at 
  and to the right of the cursor moves one column left. </p>
  <h4>Restriction </h4>
  <p>This facility has somewhat limited value in practice because it must be prepared 
  in advance. It is activated only if at least one of the installed operating systems 
  has at least one of the following properties (in which the path and options are 
  case-insensitive): </p>
  <ol>
    <li>The options include <span class="switch">/redirect</span> and the title 
    is longer than 57 characters. The title will be truncated to 57 characters, 
    with “ [EMS enabled]” appended. </li>
    <li>The options include a forward slash, after which there is no
    <span class="switch">nodebug</span> or <span class="switch">crashdebug</span>, 
    but there is either <span class="switch">debug</span> or
    <span class="switch">baudrate</span>, and the path does not begin with “C:\” 
    (not counting the quotes). The loader will have appended “ [debugger enabled]” 
    to a possibly truncated title. </li>
    <li>The options include <span class="switch">/win95dos</span> or
    <span class="switch">/win95</span>. </li>
    <li>The path is exactly “C:\” (not counting the quotes). </li>
  </ol>
  <p>What might have been a valuable use for this facility is missed because of 
  these constraints. Imagine that kernel-mode debugging is wanted for finding why 
  some computer will not start, but the computer is the possession of an ordinary 
  user and its BOOT.INI file on the local hard disk has no entry that would enable 
  debugging. Among the available strategies is to boot an operating system from 
  another device, as with MS-DOS from a floppy disk or the Windows Recovery Console 
  from a CD, then edit the BOOT.INI on the hard disk before rebooting from the hard 
  disk. Another is to boot from the hard disk as normal but press F5 or F8 for the 
  Windows Advanced Options Menu: the effect of the Debugging Mode option in this 
  menu is essentially to add a <span class="switch">/debug</span> option, so that 
  Windows will then start with default connection parameters for kernel-mode debugging. 
  Plainly better would be to boot from the hard disk but have some way to specify 
  your ideal connection parameters. You would get exactly this from the
  <span class="keyword">unsupporteddebug</span> facility, but only if the problem 
  machine is already prepared. </p>
  <h2>Applicability </h2>
  <p>This note is based on inspection of the NTLDR from Windows XP Service Pack 
  1a. However, perusal of earlier Windows versions for a revision of this article 
  in 2007 has shown that the features described above date from at least the original 
  Windows 2000 and continue at least until Windows Server 2003 Service Pack 1 (as 
  does, incidentally, the coding error). </p>
  <h3>Windows Vista </h3>
  <p>The boot sequence has been reworked for Windows Vista and the particulars given 
  above are inapplicable. However, the intention to these enhancements is accommodated 
  by the new coding, and is even improved. At the Windows Boot Manager menu, while 
  the current selection corresponds to an installation of Windows Vista or later, 
  press F10 to be taken to <a href="editoptions.htm">the Edit Boot Options menu</a>.
