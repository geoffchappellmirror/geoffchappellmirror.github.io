<h1>HAL Exports Added For Version 4.0 </h1>
<p>This page lists the four functions that were added to the HAL for version 4.0, 
i.e., for Windows NT 4.0. All are still exported from the x86 builds as of version 
10.0. However, only one is exported from any x64 build. </p>
<!--webbot bot="Include" U-Include="../../_include/colours.htm" TAG="BODY" startspan -->

<p>Documentation status is summarised by colour coding. <span class="NoScript">(Had 
the website’s scripts run as expected, then hovering over any colour-coded text 
would produce a tooltip that shows why the text is coloured.) </span>
<span class="ScriptOnly">(To decode a colour, hover for a tooltip.) </span></p>
<p>Functions that appear to be completely undocumented are
<span class="undocumented">highlighted yellow</span>. If a function is documented 
now but was not documented in the first contemporaneous Device Driver Kit (DDK), 
Windows Driver Kit (WDK) or Installable File System (IFS) Kit, then it is
<span class="delayed">shaded yellow</span> to retain some of its previous status. 
If a function is documented as reserved or obsolete, it is
<span class="reserved">shaded red</span> or <span class="obsolete">shaded grey</span>, 
respectively. Otherwise, functions that have their own non-trivial documentation 
are left with no background colour. </p>
<p>Many undocumented functions and some variables have C-language declarations in 
one or another header file. To show them as being not completely undocumented they 
are <span class="declared">shaded orange</span>, except for one special case. Some 
declarations are known only from “minwin” headers that Microsoft published in early 
editions of the WDK for Windows 10 which seem since to have been withdrawn. These 
are <span class="minwin">highlighted orange</span> to indicate that public disclosure 
even of the declaration was exceptional. </p>
