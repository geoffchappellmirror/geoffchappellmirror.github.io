<h1>SHRestricted </h1>
<p>This function gets the value of a shell restriction. </p>
<h2>Declaration </h2>
<pre class="source">DWORD SHRestricted (RESTRICTIONS rest);</pre>
<h3>Parameters </h3>
<p>The <span class="argument">rest</span> argument selects the restriction whose 
value is wanted. The supported values in the <span class="enum">
<a href="restrictions.htm">RESTRICTIONS</a></span> enumeration are listed separately, 
since there are many members and also some awkward variations with the SHELL32 version.
</p>
<h3>Return Value </h3>
<p>The function returns the value of the selected restriction, else zero. </p>
<h2>Behaviour </h2>
<p>The shell restrictions are defined as a set in the sense supported by the SHLWAPI 
function <span class="function">
<a href="../../../shlwapi/api/util/restrictions/lookup.htm">SHRestrictionLookup</a></span>. 
Each restriction is implemented as a registry value in some subkey of
<span class="regkey">Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies</span> in 
either the <span class="regkey">HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE</span> or
<span class="regkey">HKEY_CURRENT_USER</span> branch, with precedence given to the 
former. Though many restrictions are booleans that specify whether a corresponding 
feature is restricted, typically as an administrative policy, the general scheme 
is that a restriction can evaluate to any DWORD, defaulting to zero. </p>
<p>Part of the SHLWAPI support is that SHELL32 provides memory for caching the values 
of the restrictions. SHELL32 expects to be notified through its
<span class="function"><a href="shsettingschanged.htm">SHSettingsChanged</a></span> 
function if any restrictions have their values changed in the registry. The
<span class="function">SHRestricted</span> function checks whether any such notifications 
have been received since the previous call to <span class="function">SHRestricted</span>. 
If they have, then the function resets its cached values of all restrictions. For 
every restriction, the next time that SHLWAPI is asked for a lookup, including for 
this call, it must refresh the cache from the registry. </p>
<h3>Old Behaviour </h3>
<p>Until version 5.00, SHELL32 implemented this function itself instead of by providing 
a table to the <span class="function">SHRestrictionLookup</span> function in SHLWAPI. 
In versions 4.71 and 4.72, this implementation did not differ very much from what 
got moved to SHLWAPI in version 5.00. Earlier versions were not so settled. </p>
<p>In the very earliest implementations of version 4.0, for both Windows 95 releases 
and for at least the original NT 4.0, restrictions are sought only in
<span class="regkey">HKEY_CURRENT_USER</span>. </p>
<p>In the Windows 95 releases and all NT 4.0 releases as late as Service Pack 5 
(but specifically not as late as Service Pack 6), the <span class="argument">rest</span> 
argument is interpreted as a combination of bit flags. The function attempts to 
get the value of each restriction that corresponds to a set bit in the
<span class="argument">rest</span> argument, and returns the first non-zero value 
it encounters. Since the order of testing is surely an implementation detail, the 
intention may have been that one call can test whether any of multiple restrictions 
has a non-zero value. </p>
<p>The Windows 95 implementations do not cache the values of any restrictions and 
they ignore restrictions when running in a clean-boot configuration. </p>
<h2>Availability </h2>
<p>The <span class="function">SHRestricted</span> function is exported from SHELL32 
as ordinal 100 in version 4.0 and higher. In version 6.0 and higher, starting from 
Windows XP SP1, the function is also exported by name. </p>
<p>Though the function dates from the original release of Windows 95, it was left 
undocumented by Microsoft until 2002 when it got listed among the
<a target="_top" href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms807073.aspx">Settlement 
Program Interfaces</a>. Even then, the function is said to require “version 5.0 
or later”. </p>
