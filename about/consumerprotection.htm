  <h1>Consumer Protection </h1>
  <p>With the development of techniques for independent analysis of commercial software, 
  those who buy software may be able to verify or disprove claims that the software’s 
  manufacturer makes about the software, or they may be able to prove the existence 
  of a defect whose existence the manufacturer denies, disclaims or ignores. </p>
  <p>That software manufacturers get away with the latter, even routinely, is surely 
  beyond dispute. Also not in doubt is that such impunity would simply not be tolerated 
  by our society for any other consumer product. That it is tolerated for software 
  is perhaps because defects in cars, planes, trains and even toasters can and do 
  kill people, and software for the home or office is thankfully not vital. But 
  it also may be that society has seen no choice: independent inspection is simply 
  not thought achievable in practice. </p>
  <p>Even if techniques for independent inspection of software are developed and 
  refined, it seems likely that the work could never realistically be undertaken 
  by the consumers themselves, nor even be instigated by any one or few of them. 
  Consumers of software are naturally much too busy with the tasks that they hoped 
  the software might help with, and the study of software is too intensive an exercise 
  to be funded just from a consumer’s frustration that the software does not seem 
  to behave quite as represented. Just as our society long ago relaxed the notion 
  of <span class="foreign">caveat emptor</span> instead of expecting all consumers 
  to do their own chemical analysis of food or clothing, the day may come when regulators 
  and watchdogs take some interest in acting on behalf of software consumers, at 
  least to the extent of checking that representations by software manufacturers 
  are credibly frank and open. </p>
  <p>Note that with techniques of analysis that do not depend on access to the software’s 
  source code, the manufacturer’s cooperation is not required. The consumer and 
  his agents merely exercise a presumed right to examine the software, in whatever 
  form the manufacturer supplies that software, to see if the software conforms 
  to its manufacturer’s claims. </p>
