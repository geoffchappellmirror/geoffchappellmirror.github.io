<h1>RtlLengthSid </h1>
<p>The <span class="function">RtlLengthSid</span> function reads enough of a supposed 
SID to compute what size if must have if the SID is valid. </p>
<h2>Declaration </h2>
<pre class="source">ULONG RtlLengthSid (PSID Sid);</pre>
<h3>Parameters </h3>
<p>The <span class="argument">Sid</span> argument provides the address of the SID.
</p>
<h3>Return Value </h3>
<p>The function returns the size in bytes. </p>
<h2>Availability </h2>
<p>The <span class="function">RtlLengthSid</span> function is exported by name from 
both the kernel and NTDLL in all Windows versions, i.e., in 3.10 and higher. It 
provides the low-level support for the documented high-level API function
<span class="function">GetLengthSid</span>, which ADVAPI32 exports by name in all 
versions. </p>
<h2>Documentation Status </h2>
<p>The <span class="function">RtlLengthSid</span> function is documented but has 
not always been. The first known documentation is from the Installable File System 
(IFS) Kit for Windows 2000, which was not widely circulated. The function is declared 
in NTIFS.H if compiling for Windows 2000 or higher. </p>
<h2>Behaviour </h2>
<p>A SID has a fixed-size header, which Microsoft defines as a
<span class="struct"><a href="sid.htm">SID</a></span> structure, and a variable-size 
continuation. The total size is eight bytes for the fixed-size portion before the
<span class="member">SubAuthority</span> array plus four bytes for each subauthority. 
The number of subauthorities is given by <span class="member">SubAuthorityCount</span> 
in the header. The function does nothing but read what would be the
<span class="member">SubAuthorityCount</span> if there is indeed a SID at
<span class="argument">Sid</span>, and feed it into this computation. Note that 
the <span class="member">SubAuthorityCount</span> is a byte, and so the computation 
cannot overflow. </p>
<h3>IRQL </h3>
<p>Before version 6.0, the kernel-mode implementation is in a paged section and 
must not be called at <span class="constant">DISPATCH_LEVEL</span> or higher. Microsoft’s 
documentation explicitly permits as high as <span class="constant">APC_LEVEL</span>. 
Version 6.0 moved the code to a non-paged section. It is safe to call at
<span class="constant">DISPATCH_LEVEL</span> or higher if the
<span class="argument">Sid</span> is known to be in locked memory. </p>
<p>The function’s brief computation is coded in NTIFS.H as a macro named
<span class="macro">SeLengthSid</span>, starting at least with the Windows Driver 
Kit (WDK) for Windows Vista. Contemporaneous documentation already has it as obsolete, 
with advice to use <span class="function">RtlLengthSid</span> instead. It would 
not have been obsolete, and may even have been useful, while the function was in 
paged memory. </p>
