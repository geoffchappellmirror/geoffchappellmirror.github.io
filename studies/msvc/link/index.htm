<h1>The Microsoft Visual C++ Linker </h1>
<p>The Microsoft Visual C++ suite includes a LINK.EXE program that works primarily 
with object files as input, to produce an executable as output, but also is capable 
of much other work concerning these and related files. The different kinds of work 
are separated by having LINK.EXE act as several programs in one. </p>
<h2>Program Selection </h2>
<p>The selection of what is effectively a program within the program depends on 
the first command-line argument: </p>
<table>
  <tr>
    <th>First Argument </th>
    <th>Sub-Program </th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><span class="switch">/dump</span> </td>
    <td><a href="dump/index.htm">Dumper</a> </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><span class="switch">/edit</span> </td>
    <td><a href="edit/index.htm">Editor</a> </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><span class="switch">/help</span> </td>
    <td><a href="help/index.htm">Helper</a> </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><span class="switch">/lib</span> </td>
    <td><a href="lib/index.htm">Library Manager</a> </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><span class="switch">/link</span> </td>
    <td><a href="link/index.htm">Linker</a> </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>These <span class="definition">selection</span> switches are case-insensitive 
and may begin with either the forward slash or the hyphen. The default, if the first 
argument is not one of these switches (including because the command line has no 
arguments), is to select the Linker. Note that the command line in question truly 
is the command line. LINK.EXE may later take options from elsewhere, notably from 
environment variables or from files, and thereafter treat these as if they had been 
given on the command line. However, none of that applies to these few switches.
</p>
<p>There is an exception to the requirement that these switches be first on the 
command line. The very first thing that LINK.EXE does with its command line is look 
for arguments that are exactly <span class="switch">-db</span> (in lower case and 
with the hyphen specifically) or which begin as <span class="switch">-db</span> 
followed immediately by at least a digit. Only the last occurrence of such an argument 
has any meaning (not that this meaning is yet pursued in this study), but all occurrences 
are removed from further consideration of the command line as if they had never 
been on it. Checking for a selection switch as the first argument is then, strictly 
speaking, the second thing that LINK.EXE does with its command line. If found, the 
selection switch also is removed from further consideration of the command line.
</p>
<h3>Front Ends </h3>
<p>The selection switches are rarely used in practice. Indeed, the Helper must be 
run very rarely indeed, else someone at Microsoft surely would have noticed (and, 
less surely, would have corrected) that the simple command <span class="command">
link /help</span> causes an <a href="help/fault.htm">Internal error during SetupPhase</a>. 
The others are typically run through one or another of the DUMPBIN.EXE, EDITBIN.EXE 
or LIB.EXE front-end programs, which each just execute LINK.EXE with the corresponding 
switch inserted into the command line: </p>
<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Front-End Command </th>
    <th>LINK.EXE Command </th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><span class="command">dumpbin </span>[<span class="placeholder">arguments</span>]<span class="command">
    </span></td>
    <td><span class="command">link -dump </span>[<span class="placeholder">arguments</span>]<span class="command">
    </span></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><span class="command">editbin </span>[<span class="placeholder">arguments</span>]<span class="command">
    </span></td>
    <td><span class="command">link -edit </span>[<span class="placeholder">arguments</span>]<span class="command">
    </span></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><span class="command">lib </span>[<span class="placeholder">arguments</span>]<span class="command">
    </span></td>
    <td><span class="command">link -lib </span>[<span class="placeholder">arguments</span>]<span class="command">
    </span></td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>The general practice throughout this documentation, is to refer to LINK.EXE as 
the linker (with a lower-case initial). To run LINK (with no extension) means specifically 
to execute LINK.EXE as the Linker (with an upper-case initial). Execution of LINK.EXE 
to run as the Dumper, Editor or Library Manager is instead referred to as running 
the corresponding front-end program, DUMPBIN, EDITBIN or LIB. </p>
<h2>Reference Versions </h2>
<p>The LINK.EXE version studied for these notes is 7.00.9466. Information about 
implementation details and (especially, one might hope) coding errors may be highly 
specific to that version. References to Microsoft’s documentation assume a roughly 
contemporaneous edition (January 2004) of the MSDN Library on CD. No plans exist 
to track future versions, of either the software or the documentation. The teams 
of programmers at Microsoft can write this stuff much faster than I can study it—and 
they also have the advantage of earning at least wage while they put their time 
into it. </p>
