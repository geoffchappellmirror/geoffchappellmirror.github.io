<h1>Executables </h1>
<p>DUMPBIN recognises as an executable any file whose size is at least 0x40 and 
whose first two bytes are MZ. This is taken to establish that the file begins 
with a structure that Microsoft defines symbolically (in the WINNT.H header from 
the Platform SDK) as an <span class="struct">IMAGE_DOS_HEADER</span>. </p>
<p>A file that meets these requirements but is not then recognisable as a 
Windows executable is said by DUMPBIN to be an “MS-DOS executable”. Presenting 
DUMPBIN with such a file produces a warning (LNK4094), with a direction to use a 
program named EXEHDR instead. The file, being identified but unsupported, is 
thereafter ignored.
</p>
<p>In a Windows executable, the <span class="member">e_lfanew</span> member of 
the DOS header will give a file offset to one or another sort of new header. 
However, in a DOS executable, this member may simply be part of the DOS 
relocation table or be padding, or even be code or data. DUMPBIN rejects the <span class="member">
e_lfanew</span> member as a file offset to a new header for a Windows 
executable, if the member is either zero or would not allow at least four more 
bytes before the end of the file. </p>
<p>DUMPBIN recognises three types of Windows executable, depending on the first 
two or four bytes of the new header: </p>
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>Size </td>
    <td>Signature </td>
    <td>Executable Type </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>four bytes </td>
    <td>PE and two null bytes </td>
    <td>Windows 32-bit executable </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>two bytes </td>
    <td>NE </td>
    <td>Windows 16-bit executable </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>two bytes </td>
    <td>LE </td>
    <td>Windows VxD </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>Presenting DUMPBIN with a Windows 16-bit executable produces a warning 
(LNK4095), again with a direction to use the EXEHDR program instead. The file, 
being identified but unsupported, is thereafter ignored. </p>
