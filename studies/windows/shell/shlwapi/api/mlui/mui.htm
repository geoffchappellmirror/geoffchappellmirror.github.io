<h1>MUI Language </h1>
<p>The MUI language is an invented name for the language that is at least considered 
for selection by the <span class="function"><a href="load.htm">MLLoadLibrary</a></span> 
function for most values of its <span class="argument">dwCrossCodePage</span> argument. 
Before the SHLWAPI version 6.00 from Windows Vista, the MUI language is also what 
is returned by the <span class="function"><a href="get.htm">MLGetUILanguage</a></span> 
function. </p>
<p>On Windows 2000 and higher, the MUI language is just the user default UI language. 
Indeed, this identity of the concepts is cemented into the SHLWAPI version 6.00 
from Windows Server 2003 and Windows Vista and higher, such that SHLWAPI simply 
calls the standard API function <span class="function">GetUserDefaultUILanguage</span>. 
Builds of version 6.00 from Windows XP and Internet Explorer 6.0, and all earlier 
versions back to 5.00, check first whether they are running on Windows 2000 or higher 
and then whether <span class="function">GetUserDefaultUILanguage</span> is available 
as an export from KERNEL32. </p>
<h2>Simulation From Registry Settings </h2>
<p>When these earlier builds execute on other operating systems, they make their 
own determination of the MUI language from the registry. The MUI language is assumed 
not to change during the current user’s session, and so this discovery is done just 
the once and is then remembered. If the following registry value </p>
<table class="Registry">
  <tr>
    <td>Key: </td>
    <td><span class="regkey">HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Internet Explorer</span>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Value: </td>
    <td><span class="regvalue">LPKInstalled</span> </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>has no more than 4 bytes of data at least one of which is non-zero, then a language 
pack is installed and the user’s language is expected from one or two other settings. 
The first is recognised only in version 5.50 and higher. </p>
<table class="Registry">
  <tr>
    <td>Key: </td>
    <td><span class="regkey">HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Shared</span>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Value: </td>
    <td><span class="regvalue">OfficeUILanguage</span> </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>For both, the first two bytes of data make the language ID. The function reads 
as many as 4 bytes, but does not insist on <span class="constant">REG_DWORD</span> 
data or check that at least two bytes of data are obtained. If there is more data, 
then the value may as well not exist. </p>
<table class="Registry">
  <tr>
    <td>Key: </td>
    <td><span class="regkey">HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Office\9.0\Common\LanguageResources</span>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Value: </td>
    <td><span class="regvalue">UILanguage</span> </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>How it comes about that registry settings whose names announce themselves as 
being meaningful for Microsoft Office should depend on a language pack whose installation 
is recorded in a setting for Internet Explorer is anyone’s guess. </p>
<p>If the language is not identified from these language-pack settings, it is sought 
instead from a setting that is specifically for Internet Explorer: </p>
<table class="Registry">
  <tr>
    <td>Key: </td>
    <td><span class="regkey">HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\International</span>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Value: </td>
    <td><span class="regvalue">ResourceLocale</span> </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>Data for this value is interpreted as the language ID, represented as case-insensitive 
hexadecimal digits, beginning with the most significant. The function accepts as 
many as 6 characters of string data, including a terminating null, or 6 bytes of 
other data (which the function will interpret as characters, provided that at least 
one is null). Characters after the hexadecimal digits are ignored. </p>
<p>If still no language ID is identified, the MUI language defaults to the <a href="install.htm">
install language</a>. Details are given separately. </p>
