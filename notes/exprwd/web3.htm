  <h1>First Impressions of Expression Web 3 </h1>
  <p>If only when installing on an old Windows version, the first unsatisfactory 
  experience with Expression Web 3 comes even before you get to use it. Expression 
  Web 3 requires Microsoft .NET Framework 3.5 SP1. This is clearly marked on the 
  side of the product box, which puzzled me since the .NET Framework is readily 
  available from Microsoft as a free download. The Expression Web installer actually 
  does invite you to download the .NET Framework. Yes, but since it’s a free download, 
  why not just supply it on the media? It’s not that the DVD is full, or anywhere 
  near it. The days of supplying free prerequisities on the media are clearly long 
  gone. Indeed, the day cannot be far away when all you get for buying software 
  at a shop is permission to download the software over the Internet. </p>
  <h2>Slow Start From New Architecture </h2>
  <p>The first thing to notice when you finally do get to start Expression Web 3 
  is how very, very slow it is to start. Perhaps I’m just too used to having almost 
  instant response from the software I bought contemporaneously with a new machine. 
  Expression Web 3 is the first new software I have bought since. Still, even on 
  a slower test machine, the original Expression Web is fully loaded to its untitled 
  unsaved page within 3 seconds, but Expression Web 3 takes longer than that just 
  to get as far as displaying its splash screen and can take a minute to get fully 
  loaded. </p>
  <p>Run the two versions under a debugger and it’s immediately clear why the new 
  is so slow to start. The original Expression Web loads barely more than 50 DLLs 
  for an initial memory use of about 10MB. Expression Web 3 loads nearly three times 
  as many DLLs for an initial memory use of about 100MB. This is mostly an artefact 
  of using the .NET Framework. Still, it must be asked: does so much greater an 
  appetite bring a correspondingly great improvement in functionality? </p>
  <h2>Now It’s Dark </h2>
  <p>The second thing to notice, once Expression Web 3 has started, is the dark 
  colour scheme. Large tracts of the screen are either black or varying shades of 
  grey, but all of them dark. Some users will like it. Some will find it hideous. 
  I find myself able to acknowledge it as looking good provided I increase the monitor’s 
  brightness sufficiently far—but then all other programs are blindingly bright.
  </p>
  <p>The Expression Web programmers can’t have been oblivious of the conflict between 
  this scheme and all standard Windows colour schemes which have black text on white 
  backgrounds for the most part and reverse this only for occasional effect. It’s 
  one thing for programmers to search for a custom appearance to make their Windows 
  program stand out, but to impose a scheme that will so obviously conflict with 
  extant configurations and long-established practices is incredibly presumptuous.
  </p>
  <p>Expression Web 3 SP1 adds a configurable setting which may be intended as some 
  sort of response to complaints about the new colour scheme. Among the Application 
  Options is one to “Use your current Windows color scheme”. Be warned that this 
  means exactly what it says. Do not imagine that it means to make Expression Web 
  3 look like other Windows programs. With this option enabled, Expression Web 3 
  does use the colours of your current Windows colour scheme, but as a palette from 
  which to choose with little regard for traditional usage. For instance, typical 
  Windows programs that show a folder list, notably the Windows Explorer, use the 
  Window colour as the Tree-View control’s background colour, but Expression Web 
  3 takes upon itself to use whatever is your Button Face colour. </p>
  <h2>Bugs in Basic Functionality </h2>
  <p>For me, the first thing to check once Expression Web 3 had started was how 
  much I would now be spared the silliness such as I describe for the original Expression 
  Web in several other pages beginning with <a href="bugs/index.htm">Expression 
  Web Bugs</a>. The depressing answer is: hardly at all. </p>
  <p>So, with the blank page already opened for me, I set about retrying my demonstrations 
  of those bugs and testing whether some expected functionality might now have got 
  implemented. Does Expression Web 3 let you rearrange rows or columns in a table 
  by dragging and dropping? No, it has been basic functionality in Microsoft’s other 
  formatted-text processors for nearly 20 years but not yet for Expression Web. 
  If you think to define an element-based style so that all tables have borders 
  by default, do you still lose pretty much all the user-interface support for tables? 
  Yes. If you wonder whether a style you have applied to some word accidentally 
  extends to the space that follows it, does the answer you get from the Apply Styles 
  pane still depend on whether you select the space from left to right or right 
  to left? Yes. Does the Format Painter yet copy styles as it did in FrontPage or 
  still does in Word? No, it applies a new style that reproduces just a selection 
  of CSS properties, and even then omits many obvious ones such as background colour. 
  And on and on. </p>
  <p>But wait, there’s more! It’s not enough that Expression Web 3 overlooks lots 
  of old bugs and persists with old deficiencies. No, we have new glitches. For 
  instance, on the initial page, write a line of text and copy it enough times so 
  that the page acquires a vertical scrollbar. Now click on the scrollbar’s up arrow 
  but hold the button down. In any Windows program, you would expect the text to 
  keep scrolling. It does in the original Expression Web. It does in the new one’s 
  Toolbox and Tag Properties panels. It does if you change to Code view—just not 
  in Design view. If that’s by design, it’s a stupid design. If it’s not by design, 
  how did it get missed? Don’t any of Microsoft’s pre-release testers ever scroll 
  text this way? Don’t any of the Expression Web experts who write about this program 
  find it remarkable that such basic user-interface functionality behaves so capriciously?
  </p>
  <h2>Crash Within Hours of Purchase </h2>
  <p>Resigned to using the program now it’s installed even though it plainly hasn’t 
  improved in basic usability, and has arguably got worse, I set about configuring 
  it to my preferences. My mistake, apparently, was that I closed the untitled page 
  that the program had opened for me automatically but which I regarded as needless. 
  It turns out that <a href="crashes/styleapplication.htm">Expression Web 3 crashes 
  when you enable Manual Style Application while no page is open</a>. Obviously, 
  this is not intended, but again I have to ask: how can it have gone unnoticed? 
  Six mouse clicks from first execution is all you need to bring down Expression 
  Web 3. </p>
  <h2>Subsites </h2>
  <p>Though you won’t know about subsites from the User Guide on Expression Web’s 
  Help menu, you may know the term from Expression Web’s context menu for folders, 
  specifically where it offers to “Convert to Subsite”. That Expression Web’s user 
  interface is chock full of elements that are entirely free of description in the 
  User Guide is a story for another time, though one which I suspect has much to 
  do with this program’s neglect of basic functionality. The subsite feature may 
  just be a hangover from FrontPage’s subwebs. Yet subsites are very useful for 
  maintaining large websites, especially ones that naturally have portions that 
  don’t have much to do with one another. This website has six subsites. </p>
  <p>In Expression Web 3, when you open a subsite, which it seems can be done only 
  by double-clicking on it as a folder in its parent site, you get the subsite’s 
  home page opened for you automatically. Moreover, if you had to authenticate for 
  access to the parent site, you will be asked to authenticate again for the subsite. 
  This is all new behaviour and it is extremely tedious, not least because it is 
  surely unnecessary. Also new is that you can’t copy or move files between subsites. 
  It used to be that you could drag from the folder tree in the window for one subsite 
  and drop into the other. You can still drag, but when you go to drop, you discover 
  that the Expression Web programmers haven’t provided any handling. </p>
  <h2>No Deadlock When Opening First Page </h2>
  <p>As good news, at least Microsoft has done something to avoid that
  <a href="hangs/1599.htm">Expression Web hangs when first opening a page</a> from 
  a site. Quick inspection confirms that Microsoft still has FPEDITAX.DLL breaking 
  the usual rules about not doing very much in a <span class="function">DllMain</span> 
  function, but who am I that I should care? Whatever they’ve done, it seems I can 
  safely let Expression Web 3 open my last-used website automatically—and that’s 
  actually something to be happy about. </p>
  <p>For better news than that, I will have to look beyond first impressions. That’s 
  what everybody must do with this program, if only unconsciously, else how is it 
  ever praised? </p>
