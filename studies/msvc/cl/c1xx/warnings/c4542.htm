<h1>Visual C++ Compiler Warning C4542 </h1>
<h2>Message Text </h2>
<pre class="output">Skipping generation of merged injected text file, cannot write <span class="placeholder">filetype</span> file: &#39;<span class="placeholder">file</span>&#39;: <span class="placeholder">message</span></pre>
<h2>Severity </h2>
<p>This is a level 1 warning, despite being insufficiently important (or too self-evident) 
for the product documentation to bother listing it. </p>
<h2>Circumstances </h2>
<p>Compilation of some source file has involved injection of text by an attribute 
provider. In response to the <span class="switch">
<a href="../../cl/options/f$x.htm">/Fx</a></span> option, the compiler has tried 
to produce an output file, here referred to as a “merged injected text” file, to 
show both the given source code and the injected source code. Warning C4542 results 
because the compiler could not create the output file. The
<span class="placeholder">filetype</span> placeholder in the message can only be 
“compiler generated”. The <span class="placeholder">file</span> is the name of the 
output file, exactly as used by the compiler when attempting the creation. The
<span class="placeholder">message</span> placeholder describes the file I/O error 
(in the limited sense offered by the CRT Library’s <span class="function">strerror</span> 
function). </p>
<p>For example, create the following fragment </p>
<pre class="source">[module (type = &quot;dll&quot;, name = &quot;Test&quot;)];</pre>
<p>as a source file named “test.cpp”, compile with the <span class="switch">/Fx</span> 
option, and confirm that the compiler produces “test.mrg.cpp” as the merged injected 
file. Now write-protect this output file. Recompile to see the warning (with
<span class="placeholder">message</span> resolved as “Permission denied”). </p>
<p>To avoid problems with creating the merged injected text file, it may help to 
know how <span class="placeholder">file</span> is chosen. The general intention 
is to form it from the pathname that the compiler uses for the corresponding source 
file, specifically by inserting “.mrg” between the file name and extension. This 
much is documented. If there is no extension, then the compiler is coded explicitly 
just to append “.mrg” to the name. </p>
<p>This last case is subject to a coding error in the compiler. For the purpose 
of deciding where to insert the “.mrg”, a file extension is understood to begin 
at the last period in the pathname, not just in the filename at the end of the pathname. 
If the source file has no extension but is placed in a directory whose path happens 
to contain a period, then the compiler will insert “.mrg” immediately before the 
last such period, most likely resulting in an attempt to create the merged injected 
text file in a directory that does not exist. </p>
<p>For example, create the fragment from earlier as a header file named simply “test” 
and create a source file named “test.cpp” that contains the line </p>
<pre class="source">#include    &quot;test&quot;</pre>
<p>Put both files in the same directory. Now the source file that produces injected 
text is the header file “test” and the merged injected text file is expected to 
be “test.mrg” in the same directory. However, if the path for the directory is, 
say, “c:\dev.net”, then the compiler tries to create the merged injected text file 
as “c:\dev.mrg.net\test”, with warning C4542 as the likely outcome in practice.
