<h1>Service Control Manager Events </h1>
<p>Although services are Win32 programs, they typically do not interact with the 
graphical user interface. Indeed, they are discouraged from doing so and Windows 
Vista does not even permit them to. For users to know what has happened with services, 
entries in the Event Log are especially important. It may help to have an overview. 
There are, of course, events that can be logged by particular services, if they 
get to execute, but attention here is confined just to events that are logged by 
the Service Control Manager (SERVICES.EXE). These are valuable for showing what 
was intended from the system’s perspective, e.g., as a record of why a particular 
service didn’t get to run. </p>
<p>In Windows Vista, SERVICES is actually three event providers: </p>
<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Provider </th>
    <th>Log </th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><a href="eventlog.htm">Service Control Manager</a> </td>
    <td>System </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td rowspan="2"><a href="diagnostic.htm">Microsoft-Windows-Services</a> </td>
    <td>Microsoft-Windows-Services/Diagnostic </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>WdiContextLog </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><a href="wpp.htm">Service Control Manager Trace</a> </td>
    <td>SCM </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>Most conspicuous is that SERVICES writes to the System log. Indeed, it is by 
far the most active contributor to that log in typical conditions. SERVICES also 
writes to an analytic log which is listed in the Event Viewer but is not ordinarily 
enabled (and is not easily enabled). Finally, there is a large amount of WPP Software 
Tracing which is hard-coded to run at startup. This captures a very detailed record 
of SERVICES’s execution, but the collected data is ordinarily going to be understood 
only by Microsoft’s own programmers who have the SERVICES source code for reference.
