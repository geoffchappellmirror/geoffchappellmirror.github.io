<h1>SHRunIndirectRegClientCommand </h1>
<p>This function executes the registry command for opening a client. </p>
<h2>Declaration </h2>
<pre class="source">HRESULT
SHRunIndirectRegClientCommand (
    HWND hWnd,
    LPCWSTR pszClientType);</pre>
<h3>Parameters </h3>
<p>The <span class="argument">hWnd</span> argument provides the window handle to 
use for message boxes while trying to execute the command. </p>
<p>The <span class="argument">pszClient</span> argument provides the address of 
a null-terminated string that names the client. </p>
<h3>Return Value </h3>
<!--webbot bot="Include" U-Include="../_include/hresult.htm" TAG="BODY" startspan -->

<p>The function returns zero for success, else an error code. </p>

<!--webbot bot="Include" i-checksum="1551" endspan -->
<h2>Behaviour </h2>
<p>The function executes whatever registry command is found from the key
<span class="regkey">HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Clients\<span class="placeholder">ClientType</span>\<span class="placeholder">default</span>\shell\Open\command</span>, 
where </p>
<ul>
  <li><span class="placeholder">ClientType</span> is the <span class="argument">
  pszClientType</span> argument; </li>
  <li><span class="placeholder">default</span> is the string data from the 
  default value of <span class="regkey">HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Clients\<span class="placeholder">ClientType</span></span>.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>This function is implemented as a call to the <span class="function">
<a href="runindirectcommand.htm">RunIndirectRegCommand</a></span> function, with
<span class="regkey">HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE</span> and <span class="regkey">
Software\Clients\<span class="placeholder">ClientType</span></span> 
as the key and subkey respectively, and <span class="verb">Open</span> as the 
verb.
</p>
<h2>Background </h2>
<p>The <span class="function">SHRunIndirectRegClientCommand</span> function 
deals specifically with opening so-called client applications, in the sense of 
Microsoft’s page
<a target="_top" href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/cc144109.aspx">
Registering Programs with Client Types</a> in the
<a target="_top" href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/bb776778.aspx">
Shell Programmer’s Guide</a>. The functionality recognises that: </p>
<ul>
  <li>applications may be seen as having a general type, such as web browser or 
  media player; </li>
  <li>that each type may be present on the computer in multiple examples, most 
  notably as competing products from different manufacturers; </li>
  <li>and that selection from among the competing applications of each type 
  should be eased. </li>
</ul>
<p>To this end, Microsoft provides that such applications be described in a 
registry key <span class="regkey">HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Clients\<span class="placeholder">ClientTypeName</span>\<span class="placeholder">CanonicalName</span></span>, 
where </p>
<ul>
  <li><span class="placeholder">ClientTypeName</span> represents the general 
  type of application </li>
  <li>and <span class="placeholder">CanonicalName</span> represents a particular 
  application of that type. </li>
</ul>
<p>Within this key may be many subkeys and values, but what is relevant to
<span class="function">SHRunIndirectRegClientCommand</span> is that the command 
to execute for opening the application is to be the default value from the key
<span class="regkey">HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Clients\<span class="placeholder">ClientTypeName</span>\<span class="placeholder">CanonicalName</span>\shell\open\command</span>.
</p>
<p>So far, so good. Microsoft documents this much on the page already cited, and 
this is enough information so that an application’s manufacturer can know what 
to set into the registry so that the application can be identified and opened as 
an example of its type of application. What Microsoft seems not to document is 
the additional setting that selects one such application to be the default 
application of its type. This is arranged by setting the <span class="placeholder">
CanonicalName</span> 
as the default value of the key <span class="regkey">
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Clients\<span class="placeholder">ClientTypeName</span></span>.
</p>
<p>For an example of how all this works, imagine products named “QuickTime 
Player” and “Windows Media Player” which are both installed as “Media” clients, 
in the sense that the registry key <span class="regkey">
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Clients\Media</span> 
has subkeys for each product. The name of one of the products is set as that 
key’s default value. That product is then the default media player. To start the 
default media player, software that knows the <span class="function">
SHRunIndirectRegClientCommand</span> 
function needn’t know which media players are installed, let alone which of them 
the user has chosen (or ignorantly allowed to remain) as the default: it simply 
calls the function, passing “Media” as the <span class="argument">pszClientType</span> 
argument. Software that doesn’t know the function can interpret the relevant 
registry keys and values itself, following the documentation. </p>
<h2>Availability </h2>
<p>The <span class="function">SHRunIndirectRegClientCommand</span> function is 
exported from SHLWAPI as ordinal 467 in late builds of version 5.00 and then in 
all higher versions. However, the function has an earlier history in SHDOCVW, 
which exports it as ordinal 190 in early builds of version 5.00, discontinues it 
in later builds of version 5.00, and reinstates it for version 5.50 and higher 
(as a simple redirection to the SHLWAPI implementation). </p>

<p>Though this function dates from as long ago as 1999, it was still not 
documented by Microsoft in the MSDN Library at least as late as the CD edition 
dated January 2004. </p>
