  <h1>Windows Archive </h1>
  <p>As with my publication of <a href="../../dos/internals/index.htm">DOS Internals</a> 
  and other work with DOS, now much more than a decade old, I am occasionally treated 
  to the surprise of an enquiry about Windows 95 or Windows 98 (though I don’t recall 
  anyone yet asking about Windows Me). I myself haven’t had any of these Windows 
  versions installed on any computer since 2003, and it has been even longer since 
  I last had any of them installed on a test machine for “live” inspection. But 
  it seems these systems are now old enough to have attracted the interest of hobbyists!
  </p>
  <p>Since some are kind enough to ask after this old material, I have archived 
  a handful of articles that seem worth saving from my old website. There are not 
  many of them, since in those days my public work was in newsgroups and similar 
  on-line forums. The old website was never meant to receive more than occasional 
  attention. Indeed, it received no attention at all for about five years until 
  2004, when it finally occurred to me that a website would be the natural medium 
  for new work. This soon outgrew the old website, which I replaced in 2007 and 
  finally deleted in 2011. </p>
  <p>These archived articles were all written between 1997 and 1999. They are the 
  last record that I have of any public writing by me about the Windows that ran 
  on DOS. I have edited them for consistency with this new web site, and in some 
  cases revised them very slightly for content. </p>
  <h2>General Articles </h2>
  <p>Some of the articles examine problems with more-or-less ordinary use of Windows:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="extract.htm">EXTRACT.EXE misses files in cabinet</a> </li>
    <li><a href="timezone.htm">Internet Mail for Microsoft Exchange misreads time 
    zone</a> </li>
    <li><a href="pws.htm">Personal Web Manager causes page fault on exit</a>
    </li>
    <li><a href="sysmon.htm">System Monitor rounds down to thousands</a> </li>
  </ul>
  <p>Others are similarly concerned with ordinary use, but to provide information 
  that may help work around a problem or avoid losing time to a quirk: </p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="spool.htm">Insufficient free disk space for printing</a> </li>
    <li><a href="shfindfiles.htm">Special characters in Find Files dialog</a>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>One more was categorised at the old website as a diversion, which was surely 
  too grand even when the program in question was in wide use: </p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="mailnews.htm">Credits for Internet Mail and News</a> </li>
  </ul>
  <p>Now that the old website truly has disappeared, I have discovered that I had 
  left there a few pages of historical record that were apparently important enough 
  to someone that a Wikipedia article (<a target="_top" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AARD_code">AARD 
  Code</a>) cited them via a third-party archive. In contrast to my unhappiness 
  at how work from this new website too often gets reproduced around the Internet 
  without attribution, I am grateful that someone preserved anything at all from 
  the old website, let alone that another went to the trouble of tracking it down. 
  Still, it’s perhaps as well that I rescue those pages to here: </p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="aard/index.htm">The AARD Code</a> </li>
    <li><a href="aard/research.htm">Record of AARD Research</a> </li>
    <li><a href="aard/firstpublic.htm">First Known Publication of AARD Details</a>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Security </h2>
  <p>Back in 1999 computer security was surely conceived as a commercial proposition 
  but was nowhere near to developing into the industry it has become. For better 
  or worse, that industry is now the channel into which almost all reverse engineering 
  seems to be directed—not by me, but certainly by just about everyone who hopes 
  to make some sort of career in it. For my part, I dabble and only so little that 
  some who reverse-engineer for security vulnerabilities don’t regard me as much 
  of a reverse engineer. Some don’t even know of me as any sort of reverse engineer, 
  no matter that I think I’ve played no small part in opening up the subject. I 
  doubt that security ever will motivate enough of my reverse engineering that I 
  think to call myself a security researcher. But my dabbling in security did start 
  long, long ago. </p>
  <p>The collection of pages on how <a href="../../security/aim/index.htm">America 
  Online Exploits Bug In Own Software</a> was moved to this new website very early. 
  I am, after all, rather proud of it. Though it’s not the world’s first published 
  analysis of a buffer-overflow vulnerability getting exploited in the wild, it’s 
  earlier than most, and nothing this old is anything like as thorough. This case 
  has the appealing twist that the attacker was the owner and denied it publicly—and 
  the less satisfying outcome that nobody at AOL seems ever to have been called 
  out for it. Indeed, AOL’s Tricia Primrose, who I all but called a liar in 1999 
  for having dismissed AOL’s exploitation of its own buffer overflow as “a fake 
  story about a fake e-mail about a fake issue” seems to have had a very successful 
  career with AOL for the next decade. This is not history for anyone in the computer 
  industry to be pleased about. </p>
  <p>In March 2019 someone wrote to me about an age-old fuss that overwrought people 
  made of noticing the name NSAKEY in a symbol file. Well, that’s how I remember 
  the issue, rightly or wrongly. Curiously enough, it happened almost concurrently 
  with the America Online issue. More curiously, the old site had a few pages about 
  the <a href="cryptoapi/index.htm">CryptoAPI</a> from Windows 95 OSR2 and had lumped 
  them with the AOL pages in a rudimentary section on Security. The AOL pages got 
  transferred in 2007 but the CryptoAPI pages got lost. As far as I can tell now, 
  they look to have been “live” at the old website from 1999 to 2011. Now I restore 
  them here at the new website but with other archived pages. Incidentally, the 
  NSAKEY gets its brief mention at the end of the page on
  <a href="cryptoapi/cspsigs.htm">CSP Signatures</a>. </p>
  <h2>For Programmers </h2>
  <p>The following article is very much for programmers: </p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="linkcpu.htm">Strange Things LINK Knows About 80x86 Processors</a>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h3>For VxD Programmers </h3>
  <p>There are also articles directed even more specifically to programmers of Virtual 
  Device (VxD) drivers for the old Windows. Some help with problems in using relevant 
  programming tools and development kits from Microsoft: </p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="wdeb386.htm">Bug-Fix Tool for WDEB386 from Windows 95 DDK</a>
    </li>
    <li><a href="parsedefdescription.htm">Internal error during ParseDefDescription</a>
    </li>
    <li><a href="parsedefsections.htm">Internal error during ParseDefSections</a>
    </li>
    <li><a href="parsevxddefexport.htm">Internal error during ParseVxdDefExport</a>
    </li>
    <li><a href="pdk.htm">Windows 95 DDK does not install after Platform SDK</a>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>Some more are early attempts at alternative documentation (including from before 
  Windows 95): </p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="codepage.htm">Code Pages and the Windows 95 IFSMGR</a> </li>
    <li><a href="vxdldr.htm">Dynamic VxD Loading (VXDLDR.386)</a> </li>
  </ul>
  <p>The exercise was, of course, to demonstrate that it can be both feasible and 
  productive to derive high-quality technical specifications by analysing binary 
  code. Especially for one of them, the interfaces studied are seemingly simple, 
  yet the manufacturer’s specification is littered with errors and omissions.
  </p>
  <p>There is also a demonstration, i.e., with binaries to run and observe, and 
  with source code you can play with: </p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="diskhook.htm">Hooking Disk Access</a> </li>
  </ul>
  <p>As far as I know, the disk-hooking sample is the only published demonstration 
  that Microsoft had a functioning VxD for the disk I/O System (IOS) in commercial 
  releases of Windows well before documenting it as new for Windows 95. </p>
  <h2>Not Yet Mouldy </h2>
  <p>Elsewhere at this website are a few articles that are similarly old but remain 
  topical and have been updated over the years, even substantially. For ordinary 
  users: </p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="../ie/orgfav.htm">Organize Favorites by Opening as a Folder</a>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>and for programmers, a collection of pages from another early attempt at alternative 
  documentation (of which I suddenly found myself rather proud when Microsoft finally 
  published official documentation in 2002): </p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="../../../studies/windows/shell/comctl32/api/da/dpa/index.htm">Dynamic 
    Pointer Arrays</a> </li>
  </ul>
  <p>Those pages are now in my study of the
  <a href="../../../studies/windows/shell/index.htm">Windows Shell</a>, which was 
  begun in 2004. Though it and the newer study of
  <a href="../../../studies/windows/ie/index.htm">Internet Explorer</a> are not 
  specifically concerned with Windows 95, Windows 98 and Windows Me, there is some 
  coverage for historical accuracy. For instance, if you want to know which of these 
  old versions export which functions, then these studies are where to look. </p>
