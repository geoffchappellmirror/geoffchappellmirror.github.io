  <h1>Browsing Without The Viewer </h1>
  <p>If you let scripts run when browsing this website, they construct a viewer 
  that places each document side-by-side with an extensive and interactive table 
  of contents (TOC) as navigation support. This is very much the
  <a href="ui.htm">preferred user interface</a>, but I do not
  <span class="emphasis">require</span> that you run my scripts. If you choose not 
  to run them, I do not leave you with a blank page or—worse—instructions to enable 
  scripts. Anyway, there’s no small chance that I have not written the scripts well 
  enough for your browser. </p>
  <h2>TOC and Document Windows </h2>
  <p>A solution of sorts is to browse the site using two windows. Some browsers 
  handle this as two tabs in the one window. If you have the desktop space, separate 
  windows will work much better. </p>
  <p>In one window, the first, follow a link to the Table of Contents. There is 
  one at the top of this page, if scripts haven’t run. Once you have the TOC, if 
  you follow a link to a document page, the browser will open a new window for the 
  document page. The two windows become respectively a TOC window and a document 
  window. </p>
  <p>Whenever you follow a link in the document window, you will just load another 
  document page into that same window. If you want to navigate the site more widely, 
  return to the TOC window without closing the document window. When you follow 
  another link from the TOC to a document page, you will load the document page 
  in that same document window. The browser’s own navigation buttons in the document 
  window will take you forwards and backwards through the document pages that you 
  have viewed, without being affected by your switching to and from the TOC window.
  </p>
  <p>As it happens, there are several TOCs. The site has several subwebs, which 
  are very nearly disjoint, in the sense that few pages in one subweb link naturally 
  to any pages in any other subweb. Add that some of these subwebs run to several 
  hundred pages and it makes sense, if only to me, that each subweb has its own 
  TOC. </p>
  <p>When a TOC is loaded without the viewer, it shows some additional links at 
  its end, as a footer. These link to the other TOCs. When you follow one of these 
  links, you load another TOC into the TOC window. The browser’s own navigation 
  buttons in the TOC window will take you forwards and backwards through the various 
  TOCs that you have accessed, independently of the history in the document window.
  </p>
  <h2>Loss </h2>
  <p>When you do not run the scripts, the TOCs are always and necessarily fully 
  expanded. On the document pages, you will miss a few refinements, the most notable 
  of which is that almost everything that is coloured, weighted, italicised or has 
  pretty much any in-line formatting has a tooltip to explain why. Mostly however, 
  you should not miss any text, at least not without a warning that there is more 
  to see. </p>
  <h2>Simulation </h2>
  <p>It amazes me, though perhaps it shouldn’t, but some browsers do not offer the 
  option to browse with scripts disabled. For instance, despite all of Microsoft’s 
  talk of this and that in Windows 10 being motivated for security, its Microsoft 
  Edge browser originally had no user-interface settings to disable scripts (though 
  later versions provide for it in the Settings, among the “Cookies and site permissions”).
  </p>
  <p>There’s nothing much I can do about such nonsense from Microsoft and others, 
  but I can at least provide a means to browse my website <span class="emphasis">
  as if</span> scripts are disabled. I give you only a semblance. Scripts still 
  run, of course, but just enough to notice that you don’t want them to and to arrange 
  that you can continue browsing the site without having to keep telling it that 
  you don't want to run scripts. To start this simulation, add “noviewer=true” as 
  an argument in the URL search string, and then refresh. </p>
