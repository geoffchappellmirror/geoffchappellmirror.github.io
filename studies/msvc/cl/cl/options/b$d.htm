<h1>CL /Bd </h1>
<p>This option enables a debugging mode. </p>
<h2>Syntax </h2>
<p>The option is <span class="switch">/Bd</span> only. </p>
<h2>Behaviour </h2>
<p>The option is acted on by CL.EXE in advance of executing compiler modules, and 
is also passed to the compiler modules. </p>
<h3>Actions by CL </h3>
<p>With <span class="switch">/Bd</span> enabled, each execution in the build is 
preceded by a description written to standard error. Each execution is typically 
described as a command, showing the module or program that will be executed, together 
with its command line. In some cases there is first a listing of environment variables 
that CL has set or of lines that CL has written into a command file. </p>
<p>To enable this debugging mode but suppress the executions, use
<span class="switch"><a href="b$z.htm">/Bz</a></span> (instead). </p>
<!--webbot bot="Include" U-Include="_include/$bv.htm" TAG="BODY" startspan -->

<p>The <span class="switch">/Bd</span> and <span class="switch">/Bz</span> options 
both disable the minimal rebuild facility, without warning. (This is not done by 
formally cancelling whatever <span class="switch"><a href="g$m.htm">/Gm</a></span> 
option enabled the minimal rebuild, and the front-end C++ compiler continues to 
get <span class="switch">-Gm</span> on its command line.) </p>
<p>The debugging mode enabled by <span class="switch">/Bd</span> and
<span class="switch">/Bz</span> also affects the compiler’s handling of exceptions. 
The top-level exception handler in CL.EXE ordinarily reports an access violation 
as an internal compiler error (D2030). However, once the debugging mode is active, 
such exceptions are left as unhandled. Something similar applies to the handling 
of exceptions while CL calls the <span class="function">_InvokeCompilerPass@12</span> 
function of any compiler module that is implemented as a DLL. </p>

<h3>Actions by Compiler Modules </h3>
<p>The <span class="switch">/Bd</span> option carries to the front-end and back-end 
compiler modules, which also modify their handling of exceptions. The usual practice 
with the sort of exception that originates from a coding error such as dereferencing 
a null pointer is to report the CPU exception as an internal compiler error (<a href="../../c1xx/fatals/c1001.htm">C1001</a>), 
perhaps disguised as an unrecoverable error (<a href="../../c1xx/fatals/c1903.htm">C1903</a>) 
or even as a something called a bad provider interaction (<a href="../../c1xx/fatals/c1904.htm">C1904</a>). 
The attendant mystery and frustration (the latter an unsurprising consequence of 
the former) are reduced by the <span class="switch">/Bd</span> option, which lets 
the exception leave the compiler as unhandled. In practice these days, the exception 
is then picked up by Dr Watson, which offers to send details to Microsoft over the 
Internet. </p>
<p>For the front-end compiler modules (C1 and C1XX, for C and C++ respectively), 
the <span class="switch">/Bd</span> option affects the handling of the
<span class="keyword"><a href="../../../language/keywords/compilebreak.htm">__compileBreak</a></span> 
keyword, so that its presence in source code causes a break to the debugger. </p>
