<h1>KERNEL32 3.51 Exports </h1>
<p>The table below lists all the functions that are exported from KERNEL32 version 
3.51. For the purpose of this study, without having found an earlier (32-bit) Windows 
NT for inspection, these functions are treated as original. Almost all are still 
exported as of version 10.0, though many are now implemented in other DLLs. </p>
<!--webbot bot="Include" U-Include="_include/colours.htm" TAG="BODY" startspan -->

<p>A summary of documentation status is conveyed by colour coding. If you browse 
with scripting enabled, hovering over any text that has a background colour should 
produce a tooltip that explains the formatting. Most exports from KERNEL32 exist 
to be used as the basis for Win32 programming by arbitrary hands and have therefore 
had non-trivial documentation all along. These are shown with no background colour. 
If the whole of the documentation is just that the function is reserved or obsolete, 
without even giving a prototype, then the function is <span class="reserved">highlighted 
red</span> or <span class="obsolete">highlighted pink</span>, respectively. Functions 
that look to be completely undocumented are <span class="undocumented">highlighted 
yellow</span>. If a function is documented now but is known not to have been documented 
immediately, especially in the contemporaneous Software Development Kit (SDK), then 
it is <span class="delayed">shaded yellow</span> to retain some of its previous 
status as undocumented. If the delayed documentation came specifically from the 
function’s listing among the
<a target="_top" href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms807073.aspx">Settlement 
Program Interfaces</a> in late 2002, then the shading is
<span class="settlement">less yellow</span> since Microsoft at least acknowledged 
that the documentation was late. An undocumented function is
<span class="declared">highlighted orange</span>, as semi-documented, if it is at 
least declared in one or another header file from an SDK or, exceptionally, a Windows 
Driver Kit (WDK). KERNEL32 is low-level enough that some functions are documented 
in the Windows Driver Kit (WDK), typically as exports from the NT kernel for use 
by ring 0 software such as device drivers, but sometimes with non-specific talk 
of being callable from user mode. Such functions are <span class="wdk">shaded blue</span> 
if they seem always to have had such documentation, but a
<span class="delayedwdk">brighter blue</span> if the WDK documentation was not immediate.
</p>

<!--webbot bot="Include" endspan i-checksum="14186" -->
<p>Though almost all KERNEL32 functions are nowadays documented, not all these original 
functions have been documented from the beginning. These are marked below with as 
much precision as I happen to know by looking at MSDN Library editions on CD, each 
dated January for 2001, 2004 and 2007. For example, if a function is not yet documented 
for the MSDN Library on CD dated January 2001 but is by January 2004, it is marked 
as “undocumented until 2001-2003”. Microsoft would have it believed that some of 
these late-documented functions require at least Windows XP. </p>
<p>Microsoft’s documentation is surely not intended nowadays, if it ever was, as 
a historical record of when any functions were first exported from KERNEL32. Though 
some of these original functions retain “Windows 95, Windows NT 3.1” as the “minimum 
operating systems”, references to early Windows versions have mostly been pruned 
from the documentation, presumably as those versions drop from being supported. 
Thus, where the MSDN Library from January 2001 typically dates these original functions 
to a “Windows NT 3.1” (not found for this study), the corresponding documentation 
from January 2004 and even January 2007 talks less specifically of “Windows NT Workstation” 
and “Windows NT Server”. In 2009, in the SDK for Windows 7, these original functions 
are typically said by Microsoft to require at least Windows 2000. Only if that SDK’s 
documentation would restrict a function to an even later version is it remarked 
on in the table. </p>
<p>All functions that are exported from version 3.51 are exported from at least 
some later version. However, some carry to version 4.0 only in the NT builds, i.e., 
not for Windows 95. If such a function is not exported from the KERNEL32 for any 
later versions of the Windows that runs on DOS, it is marked “NT only”. A function 
that is marked “NT-only in 4.0” is skipped for Windows 95 but is picked up for Windows 
98, i.e., version 4.10. </p>
<p>It ought perhaps also to be stressed here that a function’s appearance in this 
table means only that the function is exported from KERNEL32 as early as some build 
of version 3.51. It does not mean that the function is implemented non-trivially 
in that version, let alone in any later versions. It does not mean that the function 
works, whether as documented by Microsoft or as supposed by anyone else. It means 
just that the function is exported and therefore can be located and called from 
outside KERNEL32, for better or worse. </p>
<p>Some few of these original functions seem always—at least in the NT builds—to 
have been implemented only as forwards to another module, such that although the 
function appears in the KERNEL32 export table, it has no code in KERNEL32. Many 
more become forwards in later versions. </p>
<p>A handful of functions eventually cease to be forwarded. One case is notable 
because it is a bug fix. Forwarding <span class="function">HeapFree</span> to the 
NTDLL function <span class="function">RtlFreeHeap</span> had the effect of making
<span class="function">HeapFree</span> appear to return only an 8-bit
<span class="type">BOOLEAN</span> instead of the documented 32-bit
<span class="type">BOOL</span>. This was not corrected until version 6.0. (It would 
be a very rare programmer who ever, let alone habitually, checks what
<span class="function">HeapFree</span> returns.) </p>
<p>Especially in version 6.1 and higher, many functions—indeed, most that are in 
everyday use by real-word programmers—are implemented within KERNEL32 only as stubs, 
to jump to a more substantial implementation elsewhere. Some stubs are nothing but 
an indirect <span class="instruction">jmp</span> instruction through a pointer in the 
Import Address Table. Others have some amount of prolog code. Identifying these 
exported functions that are implemented as jumps can involve some editorial assessment 
and is anyway likely to be always a work in progress. </p>
