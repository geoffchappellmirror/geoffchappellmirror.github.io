  <h1>The OEMTABLE in DOSSETUP.INI </h1>
  <p>The most extensive list that I know Microsoft ever published, so to speak, 
  of licensed OEM variants of MS-DOS is in the DOSSETUP.INI file on the installation 
  discs for MS-DOS 6.00 and then in upgrade discs for minor versions. </p>
  <p>The DOSSETUP.INI files on these discs are not in plain text. They are binaries 
  in a possibly unique file format, almost certainly compiled in some way from a 
  source document that is written in something like plain text. The overall 
  purpose is, of course, to guide the SETUP program’s installation of the new DOS. Among the possibilities is that the new 
  DOS is to replace a possibly very different old DOS. Deleting everything from 
  the old DOS might go too far for an upgrade, but care is needed not to retain 
  anything that might conflict. Within any one version of the old DOS, different 
  OEM variants can have come with different programs and drivers that were thought 
  to add value but which might now be problematic. There are many strategies for 
  clearing the deck. Some old files are deleted, others renamed. Old drivers, even 
  if they’re not deleted, are disabled by removing references to them in CONFIG.SYS. 
  Some programs and drivers are retained for continued use but with a reconfiguration 
  of SETVER.EXE so that they’ll think they’re still being run on the old DOS. To 
  get all this right, SETUP needs to identify whose old DOS is being replaced and 
  to know how to go about it—and the necessary information can only be on the installation 
  discs. It might have been obscured in the code and data of some executable, 
  even in the SETUP program, but it was apparently more 
  convenient to have it lightly obscured in a self-standing database. </p>
  <p>The particular DOSSETUP.INI file that I extract details from for this page 
  is dated 10th March 1993. By then, MS-DOS was pretty much settled as a retail 
  product such that the rich variety of OEM releases in early DOS versions was all 
  but history. A catalogue of all OEM variants that ever got released would be unreasonable 
  to expect. For one thing, Microsoft plausibly never had enough control over—nor 
  even interest in knowing—the details of what its many OEMs did to its product. 
  For another, comprehensiveness over either the whole of DOS’s history or the whole 
  range of OEMs is not needed, just of old DOS versions that Microsoft perceived 
  as worth troubling over for safely setting up MS-DOS 6.00. Still, that’s no small 
  goal. Some effort evidently was made to track down OEM variants that were still 
  in circulation, or even might be, for use on computers that the new DOS could 
  possibly be installed on. There is in DOSSETUP.INI very much a sense of tidying 
  up. Its data on old DOS versions would be worth having on the historical record 
  just for Microsoft’s perspective near the end, even if catalogues of OEM variants 
  were not otherwise so rare. </p>
  <p>But first, some background to how I come to write about this now, in 2022, 
  after nearly thirty years… </p>
  <h2>DR DOS </h2>
  <p>I had long forgotten that I ever looked at this. Setup programs hardly ever 
  have my attention. My interest is in opportunities for novel interaction with 
  running systems, by which time the setting up is done and dusted. That I had given 
  even brief attention to the setting up of MS-DOS 6.00 turned up last year when 
  the <a href="../../../../windows/archive/aard/index.htm">AARD code</a> (in a Windows 
  3.1 beta from December 1991) was brought back to mind and I reviewed email with 
  Andrew Schulman from the early 1990s for background to what I ever knew then of 
  DR DOS from studying Microsoft’s programming—so, really, not what I knew of DR 
  DOS but of what I knew of what Microsoft knew of DR DOS. </p>
  <p>It may or may not surprise, depending on perspective, but explicit reference 
  to DR DOS is exceedingly rare in Microsoft’s contemporaneous DOS and Windows programs, at least 
  in the parts that I ever studied. I say this generally as one of the first people 
  anywhere to have studied DOS at scale by disassembly, and I say it specifically 
  as the first person outside Microsoft, as far as I know, to have understood what 
  exactly the AARD code tested. That the AARD code’s target was DR DOS is beyond 
  reasonable doubt—but it is not knowable from the AARD code alone, which merely 
  tests whether what’s executing it is credibly MS-DOS (including PC DOS and 
  other licensed variants). </p>
  <p>Something similar is true of other cases that are sometimes cited as dirty 
  tricks directed at DR DOS. On 20th April 1993, Andrew sent me a draft of what 
  would eventually be pages 199 to 204 of <span class="citation">Undocumented 
  DOS, Second Edition</span>, ISBN 0-201-63287-X. The topic was what may be Microsoft’s 
  earliest test for MS-DOS, seen then in a “QC.EXE (dated April 6, 1990)” from Quick 
  C but since known in a QP.EXE dated as long ago as 4th May 1989 from
  <a href="https://winworldpc.com/download/c3b2c390-c3a8-e284-a2e2-84a22511c3a4">
  Quick Pascal version 1.0</a>. Andrew’s draft had it that the “sole purpose of 
  this code is to make QuickC users think they shouldn’t be running DR DOS”—and 
  as shown pictorially at
  <a href="http://www.os2museum.com/wp/how-to-void-your-valuable-warranty">How to 
  Void Your Valuable Warranty</a>, the test does indeed catch DR DOS version 3.40—but 
  neither the test’s coding nor the text that’s shown if the test for MS-DOS fails 
  makes any explicit reference to DR DOS. </p>
  <p>At the time, I was not at all concerned with whether evidence actually did 
  exist that the test was directed at DR DOS. My criticism of the draft was for 
  what I saw as the far greater defect of overlooking the recklessness of some programming 
  in Novell NetWare. Microsoft’s test temporarily changes DOS’s current PSP to 0000h 
  and FFFFh to see if these changes turn up in the MS-DOS kernel’s data exactly 
  where expected. Andrew, as have many others since, took these values as unexpected 
  and even as perverse. My assessment, then and since, is that in an idealised world 
  where all DOS programmers understand the theory of DOS’s limited re-entrancy, 
  and bother to conform to it, Microsoft’s test is safe. Indeed, Microsoft’s programmers 
  had good cause to think that if they must test invasively, then what they devised 
  was optimally small, quick and unobtrusive. In the real world, however, it fouls 
  NetWare’s hook of <span class="instruction">int 21h</span> function 50h. Looking 
  now in 2022 I notice that the test’s use of <span class="instruction">int 21h</span> 
  function 50h to set these peculiar values attracted no comment when captured on 
  page 19 of the earlier edition, <span class="citation">Undocumented DOS</span>, 
  ISBN 0-201-57064-5, from October 1990. That it got Andrew’s attention in 1993 
  was because Novell complained of collateral damage. There was a good story to 
  be had from this, certainly, but we differed completely on perspective: he sympathised 
  with Novell and I thought Novell had barely begun to get what their programming 
  deserved. </p>
  <p>Still, I evidently did keep in mind Andrew’s interest in DR DOS. As it happened, 
  MS-DOS 6.00 got its commercial release at roughly this time and I bought it a 
  few days later, on 24th April 1993. After a few more days, email to Andrew on 
  29th April 1993 reported that the SETUP program’s automated identification of 
  the existing DOS installation detects DR DOS specifically: </p>
  <pre class="email">The funny thing is that given DOS version 3.31, Setup will look in files
COMMAND.COM, KEYB.COM and UNDELETE.COM for the string "Digital Research".
If any of these are found, the subsequent menu box highlights OTHER as
the DOS type.  This is the only case where OTHER will be chosen
automatically.  I was wondering if it is one rare instance of Microsoft
code recognising DR-DOS (specifically, as against general defensiveness).</pre>
  <p>Having long forgotten all this myself, I can’t be surprised if it was never 
  picked up by anyone else, yet the question of what attention Microsoft gave to 
  DR DOS was no small background in court cases over the next decade or two. Roughly 
  speaking, recognition of DR DOS by Microsoft as a competitor to MS-DOS was something 
  that Caldera, who owned DR DOS by then, sought to emphasise and Microsoft to diminish. 
  Make what you want of it from each side’s court filings, but here, in 1993, when 
  Microsoft wanted to help its MS-DOS customers get rid of their DR DOS, it evidently 
  suited Microsoft to recognise DR DOS even to the point of accepting it as some 
  sort of OTHER DOS. </p>
  <h2>Known OEM Variants </h2>
  <p>For the presentation that follows of OEM variants as known from DOSSETUP.INI, 
  my aim is to capture what SETUP can list as the DOS Type on the early screen 
  whose main content looks something like the following. </p>
  <pre class="output">Setup will use the following system settings:

┌───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ DOS Type:       MS-DOS                                    │
│ MS-DOS Path:    C:\DOS                                    │
│ Display Type:   VGA                                       │
│                                                           │
│ The settings are correct.                                 │
└───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

If all the settings are correct, press ENTER.

To change a setting, press the UP ARROW or DOWN ARROW key until
the setting is selected. Then press ENTER to see alternatives.</pre>
  <p>When SETUP is run on an old DOS, it can know this existing DOS’s version number 
  from what <a href="index.htm"><span class="instruction">int 21h</span> function 
  30h</a> returns in <span class="register">al</span> and <span class="register">
  ah</span>. This function also returns an OEM number in <span class="register">
  bh</span>, but most OEM variants return either 00h or FFh for this, rather than 
  anything more reliably informative, and SETUP apparently does not use it, even 
  when it is not 00h or FFh. The OEM names that SETUP lists as possible for the 
  installed DOS version are instead learnt from DOSSETUP.INI. There are two parts 
  to this: what can be identified with confidence; what can be listed for the user 
  to choose from. </p>
  <p>Automated identification comes from the OEMTABLE section. For each DOS version 
  from 2.11 to 6.00, the OEMTABLE lists files for SETUP to examine. For each file, 
  the table lists sequences of characters whose presence in the file suggests that 
  the installed DOS is a particular OEM variant. The first match for the installed 
  version is what SETUP shows by default for the DOS Type. Importantly, not all 
  the OEM variants that are known to DOSSETUP.INI can be identified automatically.
  </p>
  <p>Separate from the OEMTABLE are sections for each of the known OEM variants, 
  distinguished by the OEM’s name and the DOS version number. These sections are 
  where DOSSETUP.INI tells what to do for cleaning up the old DOS installation. 
  Importantly, DOSETUP.INI has more of these sections than the OEMTABLE section 
  has of OEM variants that can be identified from searching files. </p>
  <p>My organisation of the DOSSETUP.INI database of OEM variants tries to synthesise 
  the one representation from these two parts. The table for each DOS version has 
  one row for each OEM variant that SETUP can list as the DOS Type for the user 
  to select from. For those OEM variants that are also in the OEMTABLE itself, the 
  second and third columns show how the variant is identified automatically by searching 
  for text in files. I do not represent anything of the cleaning up, just of what 
  OEM variants are known to the database and of how they are identified. </p>
  <p>For some few cases, but for more if I persist with it as an occasional diversion, 
  I link to an abandon-ware site where the information from DOSSETUP.INI can be 
  verified against disk images. Regrettably, most information that circulates about 
  OEM variants of old DOS versions is at the level of very rough folklore. This 
  was entirely understandable in the 1980s and 1990s when obtaining any OEM variant 
  typically came at the cost of obtaining a matching computer, but it is unforgivable 
  now in the 2020s when OEM variants are readily available (lawfully or not) on 
  abandon-ware sites. </p>
  <h3>Version 2.11 </h3>
  <p>DOS version 2.<span class="placeholder">xx</span> exists in OEM variants for 
  computers that are so far from PC compatibility that MS-DOS 6.00 likely could 
  not boot. Such variants arguably should not be expected in DOSSETUP.INI, for surely 
  the SETUP program detects first that there’s no point to proceeding. Even if if 
  it doesn’t, it might be forgiven: since version 2.11 is known from as early as 
  1983, Microsoft’s giving it any attention at all in a setup program ten years 
  later must count very much to Microsoft’s credit. </p>
  <p>As it happens, the attention that version 2.11 was given is not insubstantial. 
  DOSSETUP.INI lists five OEM variants to identify by searching files and one more 
  to list as an option in addition to plain MS-DOS and OTHER: </p>

  </table>
  <p>Inasmuch as Microsoft would have listed an IBM variant if one existed, the 
  DOSSETUP.INI list is supporting evidence that there is indeed no PC DOS version 
  2.11. Instead, a
  <a href="https://winworldpc.com/download/44c2ac7d-cb9c-c2b4-e280-a111c3a4c2ac">
  PC DOS 2.10</a> is known from archive sites. Something similar may apply to COMPAQ, 
  who one might think already had Microsoft’s attention almost as much as did IBM. 
  The suggestion then is that no COMPAQ version 2.11 exists, either. What an archive 
  site presents as a
  <a href="https://winworldpc.com/download/3bdbab0a-6cda-11eb-b764-0200008a0da4">
  2.11 [Compaq OEM]</a> answers <span class="instruction">int 21h</span> function 
  30h as version 2.10—as does the slightly different IBMDOS.COM from
  <a href="https://winworldpc.com/download/40c2b9e2-80a-4218-c39a-11c3a4e284a2">
  2.12 [Compaq OEM]</a>. </p>
  <p>The version 2.11 from OLIVETTI has a non-trivial OEM number, 23h, by which 
  it might better have been identifed. All the others that are known both from DOSSETUP.INI 
  and from an archive site have FFh as the OEM number. This includes ZENITH, though 
  later versions of it are known with the unique OEM number 05h. </p>
  <p>The AT&amp;T that I found for inspection does not have the ramdisk.dev file. 
  Unusually, the identifer for this file is not text that suggests the OEM by name. 
  It is instead, in upper case, a series of <span class="instruction">push</span> 
  instructions, for registers <span class="register">ax</span>,
  <span class="register">bx</span>, <span class="register">cx</span>,
  <span class="register">dx</span>, <span class="register">di</span> and
  <span class="register">si</span>. The TANDY has the expected lpdrvr.sys but the 
  identifier is present only as “Tandy”, i.e., in mixed case, not upper case. My 
  presumably quick notes on SETUP from 1993 do not record whether the identifiers 
  are case-insensitive. The WYSE has a sys.com without “Wyse Tech” in any mix of 
  case, and its fdisk.com has “WYSE Tech” not “Wyse Tech”. The ZENITH has copyright 
  notices for Zenith Data Systems in many of its programs such as FORMAT.COM, so 
  why it has no identifiers in DOSSETUP.INI is some small mystery. </p>
  <p>See that tools for low-level disk access, often with the standard names FDISK, 
  FORMAT and SYS, figure prominently among the files that SETUP searches. At least 
  until version 3.20 introduced Generic I/O Control to DOS’s
  <span class="instruction">int 21h</span> interface, OEMs had little choice but 
  to write their own tools for such work as formatting DOS volumes. Even after this 
  new support allowed the hardware-dependent aspects to move to IO.SYS or to a driver, 
  some OEMs persisted with their own tools. To the MS-DOS 6.00 SETUP, some of these 
  old tools are programs that are important to delete, e.g., so that an old FDISK.COM 
  does not get executed in preference to the new FDISK.EXE. Because of this attention 
  they may also have seemed natural as candidates for the automated OEM identification.
  </p>
  <p>The user whose version 2.11 is not identified automatically may have wondered 
  how to choose between MS-DOS and OTHER. As far as DOSSETUP.INI specifies, there 
  is no difference. For both, SETUP is to delete fdisk.com and the same selection 
  of keby<span class="placeholder">xx</span>.com variants. </p>
  <h3>Version 3.00 </h3>
  <p>DOSSETUP.INI knows of version 3.00 only as MS-DOS,
  <a href="https://winworldpc.com/download/221974c3-a5c2-b4cb-8611-c3a4c2ac5a54">
  IBM PC-DOS</a> and OTHER, with no automated identification at all. </p>
  <p>Version 3.00 may be a little like 2.11 in that some OEM variants will have 
  been specific to computers that are too far from PC compatibility for running 
  MS-DOS 6.00. Yet this can’t be the whole explanation for why DOSSETUP.INI has 
  so little data for this version. Notably, archive sites have a version 3.00 from
  <a href="https://winworldpc.com/download/c3a47e07-c692-3e1a-11c3-a6e280947e52">
  COMPAQ</a> (with OEM number 00h). Not only would COMPAQ not ordinarily be dismissed 
  as insufficiently PC-compatible, but the COMPAQ version 3.00 is a good bit more 
  advanced than the same version of PC DOS, e.g., for handling
  <span class="instruction">int 21h</span> function 33h on the caller’s stack and 
  for implementing <span class="instruction">int 21h</span> function 5D0Ah at all.
  </p>
  <h4>Version 3.05 </h4>
  <p>Version 3.00 is arguably under-rated in DOS histories. It introduced file sharing 
  and network redirection as optional extensions, and provided that a computer running 
  MS-DOS could be a network server. But development of these features was uneven 
  across OEMs. As with COMPAQ, some OEM releases of version 3.00 have functionality 
  that was not widely established until version 3.10. In-between are a few known 
  releases, notably for Apricot, that answer to <span class="instruction">int 21h</span> 
  function 30h as version 3.05 (though in Apricot’s case, nearby copyright notices 
  are for “MS-DOS version 3.06”). DOSSETUP.INI does know of Apricot for version 
  3.30, but it knows nothing of anyone’s version 3.05. </p>
  <h3>Version 3.10 </h3>
  <p>It was version 3.10 that stabilised most of the DOS kernel’s data so that support 
  for file sharing and network redirection as optional extensions could be less 
  version-dependent. Not coincidentally it is the earliest version that Windows/386 
  and later Windows 3.0 Enhanced Mode ever tolerated. Hardware dependencies, however, 
  lived on. </p>

  <p>Version 3.10 is the earliest for which DOSSETUP.INI knows of COMPAQ. As with 
  IBM PC-DOS, COMPAQ is left for the user to select. Both have OEM number 00h, but 
  even this early COMPAQ already has the same feature that Windows versions since 
  2.01 in 1987 use to distinguish COMPAQ from IBM: the six letters of “COMPAQ” are 
  at offset 06h in IBMBIO.COM (and in memory at segment 0070h). </p>
  <p>The HP that has been found for inspection also has OEM number 00h. For it too, 
  no automated identification is defined, though surely it could have been: its 
  IO.SYS has a copyright notice for Hewlett-Packard (and if for some reason the 
  DOS system files are not to be searched, then a copyright notice in FDISK.COM 
  might have suited). </p>
  <p>Though other versions of OLIVETTI have their own OEM number, 23h, the version 
  3.10 that is known from an archive site has FFh. This version of the ZENITH is 
  the first that has the unique OEM number 05h. </p>

  <p>All the OEM variants that are known to DOSSETUP.INI for version 3.20 and are 
  yet found at an archive site have OEM number FFh, except for: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>IBM PC-DOS (00h); </li>
    <li>HP (00h); </li>
    <li>Olivetti (23h); </li>
    <li>Zenith (05h). </li>
  </ul>
  <p>It’s perhaps as well to observe that even where the OEM’s name is the identifier 
  that SETUP searches for, it is often present in a copyright notice, but is not 
  necessarily. The AMSTRAD that has been found for inspection is an example. It 
  has a mouse.com that contains AMSTRAD, but in an error message. The two copyright 
  notices in the program are for MEJ Electronics Ltd. </p>
  <p>For the ATT, the expected “By AT&amp;T” in graphics.com and gwbasic.exe is 
  present only as “by AT&amp;T”. </p>
  <p>The archive site I looked at does not have COMPAQ version 3.20, but Microsoft 
  seems to have believed one exists. </p>

  NEC</a> version 3.20 is known, but it has a keybuk.com, not the expected keybuk.exe, 
  and it does not contain the expected identifier. (Its copyright notice is for 
  Phoenix Technologies Ltd.) </p>
  <p>The TOSHIBA, if only as found for inspection, has the distinctive names TBIOS.SYS 
  and TDOS.SYS for its system files. </p>
  <p>The entry for WYSE in version 3.20 is problematic. It’s in the OEMTABLE section 
  for identification by searching files but DOSETUP.INI has no section for listing 
  WYSE as a DOS Type for version 3.20. It does for 3.21, however. Either way, none 
  has yet been found for inspection. &nbsp;</p>

  <p>As far as Microsoft is concerned for DOSSETUP.INI, there never was an MS-DOS 
  3.31 or PC DOS 3.31—at least, not to list as its own DOS Type—and yet an
  <a href="https://winworldpc.com/download/40c2b855-0818-c39a-11c3-a4e284a2c3a5">
  MS-DOS 3.31</a> (with OEM number FFh) circulates on the Internet. Conversely, 
  COMPAQ (with OEM number 00h) plainly is known for version 3.31, apparently as 
  having skipped 3.21 and 3.30. </p>
  <p>Only for version 3.31 is OTHER ever selected automatically. The expected files 
  with the expected identifier are found in
  <a href="https://winworldpc.com/download/936e7cfa-65ed11ea-8c4a-fa163e9022f0">
  DR DOS 6.0</a>. This, famously, is not any sort of OEM variant of MS-DOS, though 
  you might not realise it from Wikipedia’s tendency to list it with MS-DOS or PC 
  DOS in one sentence on equal footing (as in the article on
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBMDOS.COM">IBMDOS.COM</a>). </p>

  <h3>Version 6.00 </h3>
  <p>DOSETUP.INI knows of version 6.00 only as MS-DOS and OTHER, with no automated 
  identification. </p>
  <h2>Later DOSSETUP.INI </h2>
  <p>A DOSSETUP.INI dated 31st May 1994 from installation discs for an MS-DOS 6.22 
  Upgrade adds a few cases. Version 6.00 is thus known to have a later release by 
  COMPAQ, distinguished by the six-character “COMPAQ” in its mode.com. </p>
  <p>Also in this later DOSSETUP.INI is some account of the minor versions that 
  followed 6.00. For these, DOSSETUP.INI records that Microsoft and IBM went their 
  separate ways for the version numbers. Version 6.10 is known only for PC-DOS and 
  OTHER, versions 6.20 and 6.22 for MS-DOS and OTHER, and version 6.30 for PC-DOS 
  and OTHER. </p>
