<h1>String Constants </h1>
<h2>Syntax </h2>
<blockquote>
  <p>[<span class="placeholder">prefix</span>]<span class="constant">&quot;</span>[<span class="placeholder">s-char-sequence</span>]<span class="constant">&quot;</span>
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The introductory sequence for a character constant is </p>
<ul>
  <li>a double-quote </li>
  <li>or a single-character <span class="placeholder">prefix</span>, which can 
  only be <span class="constant">L</span> or <span class="constant">S</span>, 
  followed immediately by a double-quote </li>
</ul>
<p>However, to have <span class="constant">S</span> as the
<span class="placeholder">prefix</span> is a fatal error (C1190) unless 
compiling for managed code (as with the <span class="switch">/clr</span> option) 
with either the <span class="switch">/E</span> option active or the <span class="symbol">
System.Object</span> 
symbol successfully imported as metadata (as from the <span class="directive">
#using &lt;mscorlib.dll&gt;</span> directive). </p>
<p>The optional <span class="placeholder">s-char-sequence</span> begins 
immediately after the opening double-quote. It is any number of elements of the 
following types in any order: </p>
<ul>
  <li>an <span class="placeholder">escape-sequence</span>, meaning a backslash 
  and one or more subsequent characters (to make an <a href="escape.htm">escape 
  sequence</a>)
  </li>
  <li>an <span class="placeholder">s-char</span>, meaning any character other 
  than a backslash, double-quote or new-line </li>
</ul>
<p>Note however that particular cases exist where escape sequences are not 
recognised and an <span class="placeholder">s-char</span> is simply any 
character other than a double-quote or new-line. Most notable are the <span class="directive">
#import</span>,
<span class="directive">#include</span>, <span class="directive">#pragma 
include_alias</span> 
and <span class="directive">#using</span> directives, where their arguments are 
interpreted as specialised string constants. </p>
<p>A double-quote where an <span class="placeholder">s-char</span> or
<span class="placeholder">escape-sequence</span> is permitted terminates the
<span class="placeholder">s-char-sequence</span>. It is an error (C2001) if the 
line ends without this closing double-quote. </p>
<p>Each <span class="placeholder">s-char</span> or <span class="placeholder">
escape-sequence</span> 
specifies one character or byte respectively of string data, if
<span class="placeholder">prefix</span> is absent, else one wide character. A 
null character is appended. It is an error (C2026) if this string data gets too 
long. The present limit is roughly 2048 bytes. (The imprecision applies when the 
string data is produced as wide characters. Conversion of one or two source-set 
characters to wide characters is done using space further into the same buffer 
in which the string data is built. The limit is therefore reached when the 
string data is a few bytes short of 2048. Exactly how short depends on the 
mixture of single-byte and double-byte characters as the limit is approached.) </p>
<p>The string constant becomes one token whose value is the string data 
specified by <span class="placeholder">s-char-sequence</span>, with a 
terminating null, represented as </p>
<ul>
  <li>a character string, if there is no <span class="placeholder">prefix</span>
  </li>
  <li>a wide-character string, if <span class="placeholder">prefix</span> is
  <span class="constant">L</span> </li>
  <li>a <span class="class">System::String</span> object, if
  <span class="placeholder">prefix</span> is <span class="constant">S</span>
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>Translation Precedence </h3>
<p>In general, the characters of a string constant are read (and the preceding 
notes on syntax are to be interpreted) as if trigraphs and line splices are 
already translated.
</p>
<p>An exception exists, whether by design or oversight. Where the introduction 
to a string constant has both a <span class="placeholder">prefix</span> and 
double-quote, the two must be consecutive in the actual input stream. Separation 
by a trigraph or line splice prevents recognition of <span class="placeholder">
prefix</span> as starting a string constant. </p>
