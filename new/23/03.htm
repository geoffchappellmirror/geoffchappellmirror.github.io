  <h1>New in March 2023 </h1>
  <p>The only new page that I actually did finish for March is not truly new. As 
  a digression in a very large page, it did not have the prominence I think it deserves 
  and so I have broken it out as its own page, and added a few thoughts. </p>
  <p>It’s about an internal routine whose source code looks like it hasn’t changed 
  in three decades. Windows retains older routines, of course, but I know of nothing 
  else in the Windows kernel that is this old without at least some change to its 
  source code. Through all these years, this routine has executed once each time 
  that Windows has started—so, not often in the early years, but tens of millions 
  of times per day may nowadays be a conservative estimate. If this alone weren’t 
  worth attention, it comes with two lessons. </p>
  <p>One is for history, from what the routine’s very peculiar coding fossilises 
  of an incapability at 64-bit arithmetic by early versions of Microsoft’s 32-bit 
  compiler. The other is for the respectability of research into Windows, past, 
  present and future. This is very dear to me and doesn’t get nearly enough consideration 
  as reverse engineering is put into use that I didn’t dare dream of thirty years 
  ago. What does this routine’s very direct transcription into ReactOS say about 
  clean-room reverse engineering, the willingness of people to claim it as what 
  they’ve done, and the susceptibility of others to accept the claims? </p>
  <p>All being well, the many unfinished edits and new pages that I started work 
  on in March, <a href="02.htm">February</a> and even <a href="01.htm">January</a> 
  will get returned to in April. An unhappy side-effect is that the live site has 
  broken links. Please bear with me. </p>
