  <h1>Boot Configuration Data (BCD) </h1>
  <p>Windows Vista has brought with it some very visible change to the earliest 
  part of the Windows startup sequence. Immediately noticeable is “What happened 
  to the boot.ini file?”, which is how Microsoft puts it in
  <span class="citation">Windows Help and Support</span>. On a computer with Windows 
  Vista as the only operating system installed on the hard disk, there is indeed 
  no BOOT.INI file. On a computer with earlier versions of Windows also installed, 
  the BOOT.INI file remains but has no entries for Windows Vista. </p>
  <p>Unfortunately, anything that might count as much of an answer to “What happened 
  to the boot.ini file?” is deemed more than Microsoft thinks you need be told just 
  from what is installed with Windows on the local hard disk. You are told that 
  “the boot.ini file has been replaced with Boot Configuration Data (BCD)” and that 
  changes can be made with “the command line tool Bcdedit”, but for information 
  about this tool, you are directed to go to Microsoft’s website and search for 
  it. Let me make that plain. You are not given a link straight to a BCDEDIT Reference 
  such as Microsoft might have included with Windows except that space was tight 
  and your topic of interest was judged a bit obscure. No, you are told that if 
  you really want it, then see if you can find it. </p>
  <p>Removal of detail in favour of looking it up on the web may be a sign of the 
  times, but it’s not as if the on-line reference material that turns up from the 
  recommended search is anyway much to speak of. It’s perhaps also a sign of the 
  times that Microsoft presents a
  <a target="_top" href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=65818">Boot Configuration 
  Data Frequently Asked Questions</a> (FAQ) apparently before, or even instead of, 
  a Boot Configuration Data Reference. Can it really be that whoever wrote “BCDEdit.exe 
  … replaces Bootcfg.exe in Windows Vista” for the FAQ did not wonder that Windows 
  Vista does not provide instructions for BCDEDIT as accessibly as did Windows XP 
  for BOOTCFG. </p>
  <p>At least as concerns ordinary users, by far the most detail that Microsoft 
  provides of the new boot options and of how to edit them is in the text that results 
  from running the BCDEDIT tool with various forms of its <span class="switch">/?</span> 
  (or <span class="switch">/help</span>) switch. Run <span class="command">bcdedit 
  /? topics</span> to get a list of many other ways to run BCDEDIT for “detailed 
  command and option information”. Run all of those, collecting their output into 
  a text file, and although it’s a strikingly clumsy way to get the information, 
  you will then have what seems to be the closest that Microsoft comes to providing 
  you with a ready reference for what startup options are supported for your computer 
  and for how to edit them. </p>
  <p>Things are not very much better for expert users and programmers. For instance, 
  where Microsoft’s package of
  <a target="_top" href="http://www.microsoft.com/whdc/devtools/debugging/default.mspx">
  Debugging Tools for Windows</a>, version 6.6.7.5, as supplied with both the Software 
  Development Kit (SDK) for Windows Vista and the contemporaneous Windows Driver 
  Development Kit (WDK), talks of configuring for kernel-mode debugging, only one 
  (brief) page is specifically for <span class="citation">Boot Options in Windows 
  Vista</span>, and this anyway misdirects that “BCDEdit is documented in Windows 
  Help and Support”. This might be just an artefact of the debugging tools having 
  been prepared ahead of Windows Vista, but the error persists in the slightly different 
  edition of this page in the WDK itself, and in the on-line version
  <a target="_top" href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa468626.aspx">
  Boot Options in Windows Vista</a> (today, 1st June 2007). </p>
  <p>It’s hard to escape that there has been a systemic failure in presenting the 
  BCD options and the BCDEDIT tool as fully formed. For instance, nowhere does Microsoft 
  seem to document the BCD options in a list of their own. Microsoft’s preference 
  is instead to list BOOT.INI options and show how these are now replaced by BCD 
  options. To some extent, this is entirely natural. Though Microsoft doesn’t seem 
  to say so anywhere, the re-engineering of boot options for Windows Vista applies 
  only as far as kernel initialisation. When WINLOAD.EXE transfers execution to 
  the kernel, it passes the applicable boot options to the kernel as a character 
  string in the style of BOOT.INI switches. The user may work with BCD options, 
  but that’s just a front-end. What counts for the kernel are the BOOT.INI switches, 
  even though they are no longer read from a BOOT.INI file. The heavier weighting 
  that the product documentation gives to BOOT.INI switches in comparison with BCD 
  options just reflects that the kernel, being large and important, dominates how 
  the product is thought about. </p>
