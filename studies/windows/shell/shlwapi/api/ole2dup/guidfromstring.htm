<h1>GUIDFromString </h1>
<h2>Declaration </h2>
<pre class="source">BOOL 
GUIDFromString(
    LPCTSTR psz,
    LPGUID pguid);</pre>
<!--webbot bot="Include" U-Include="../_include/aw.htm" TAG="BODY" startspan -->

<p>The function exists in ANSI and Unicode forms. </p>

<!--webbot bot="Include" i-checksum="40026" endspan -->
<h3>Parameters </h3>
<p>The <span class="argument">psz</span> argument is the address of an array of 
characters which begin with a string representation of the CLSID. </p>
<p>The <span class="argument">pclsid</span> argument is the address of a 10h-byte 
buffer that is to receive the binary representation of the CLSID. </p>
<h3>Return Value </h3>
<!--webbot bot="Include" U-Include="../_include/bool.htm" TAG="BODY" startspan -->

<p>The function returns TRUE for success, else FALSE for failure. </p>

<!--webbot bot="Include" i-checksum="21964" endspan -->
<h2>Behaviour </h2>
<p>The function succeeds if the input begins with a string representation of a CLSID, 
i.e., characters that match the well-known template <span class="clsid">{<span class="placeholder">xxxxxxxx</span>-<span class="placeholder">xxxx</span>-<span class="placeholder">xxxx</span>-<span class="placeholder">xxxx</span>-<span class="placeholder">xxxxxxxxxxxx</span>}</span> 
in which each <span class="placeholder">x</span> stands for any case-insensitive 
hexadecimal digit. Though the first character must be an opening curly brace, characters 
after the closing curly brace are irrelevant to the function, and are ignored. (Microsoft 
has code, in SHELL32, that depends on this.) </p>
<p>This function is natively ANSI. </p>
<h2>Availability </h2>
<p>The <span class="function">GUIDFromString</span> function is exported from SHLWAPI.DLL 
as ordinals 269 and 270 (for ANSI and Unicode forms, respectively) in version 5.00 
and higher. It is also exported from SHELL32.DLL as ordinals 703 and 704 in version 
4.71 and higher. The implementation in SHELL32 version 5.00 and higher is just to 
jump to the coding in SHLWAPI. </p>
<!--webbot bot="Include" U-Include="../_include/undoc500.htm" TAG="BODY" startspan -->

<p>Though this function dates from as long ago as 1999, it was still not 
documented by Microsoft in the MSDN Library at least as late as the CD edition 
dated January 2004. </p>

<!--webbot bot="Include" i-checksum="43429" endspan -->
<p>The function has got documented since, apparently some time during 2005 or 2006, 
but anyway in time for the Windows Vista Software Development Kit (SDK) dated January 
2007. None of that SDK’s header files declare the function. As if to compensate, 
Microsoft gives too much by dating this function from Windows 95 and even Windows 
NT 3.5. It is coded in SHELL32 as early as version 4.00 (from Windows 95) but not 
as an exported function. </p>
