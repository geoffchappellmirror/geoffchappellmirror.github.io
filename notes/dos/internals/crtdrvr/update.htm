  <h1>Updated CRTDRVR Library </h1>
  <p>The original code in CRTDRVR.ASM, which was written in 1992, was revised in 
  June 1996 to fix a bug (that had gone unnoticed for an embarrassingly long time) 
  and to accommodate some changes that Windows 95 makes to DOS’s startup. These 
  revisions are presented together in the new source code but described here separately.
  </p>
  <h2>Bug Fix </h2>
  <p>The driver library has a surprisingly serious bug that is activated when the 
  library is used together with the scheme that Chapter Six of
  <span class="citation">DOS Internals</span> presents for resident programming. 
  In that scheme, segments are rearranged from the DOSSEG order of code then data 
  (essential to the standard run-time library of Microsoft C) to the preferred order 
  of resident then non-resident. When devising the one programming scheme, I failed 
  to allow for the rearrangement devised in the other. Put the two together and 
  the bug corrupts one word at an essentially random address just as the driver 
  is about to return to SYSINIT after initialising. This bug is fixed by adding 
  two lines to the CRTDRVR.ASM source code. </p>
  <h2>Windows 95 Update </h2>
  <p>The release of Windows 95 requires one change to the techniques used in CRTDRVR 
  and makes another change convenient. The change that must be made is due to something 
  that may reasonably be deemed a bug in the DOS 7 kernel. The other change is possible 
  only because the DOS 7 kernel fixes something that may reasonably be deemed a 
  bug in earlier versions of the kernel. </p>
  <h3>Resident Termination Must Be Fixed … </h3>
  <p>New code in the DOS 7 kernel (previously MSDOS.SYS but now bound into IO.SYS) 
  makes int 21h function 31h unsafe to use during device driver initialisation. 
  This affects any device driver produced by linking the CRTDRVR library with code 
  for a DOS program that terminates and stays resident. </p>
  <p>Certain VxDs in Windows 95 need to know whether any DOS device drivers and 
  programs have used resources of interest. For instance, have any hooked int 13h 
  or a hardware interrupt? The general scheme for supporting this from the DOS side 
  is that some DOS component takes a snapshot of the system state each time a DOS 
  device driver gets loaded or a DOS program gets run. When the driver or program 
  is done, the system state is compared with the snapshot to discover any changes. 
  Information about the driver or program may then be recorded for VxDs to study 
  later. </p>
  <p>When SYSINIT loads device drivers, only it can easily know when the device 
  driver returns from its initialisation, and so SYSINIT has the job of watching 
  for drivers that change the system state. The information that SYSINIT records 
  about the drivers it loads is entered into structures that are documented in the 
  RMD.H file supplied with the Windows 95 DDK and are retrievable at run-time via 
  int 2Fh function 1690h (which is documented as <span class="constant">W386_Return_RMD</span>).
  </p>
  <p>When SYSINIT is finished loading device drivers, the DOS kernel picks up the 
  job of watching for resource use by DOS programs. SYSINIT finds some memory for 
  the DOS kernel to use. Some of this memory is used and reused for the snapshots 
  of system features that DOS will take before each program’s execution. Some of 
  the memory is to serve as a permanent record that may be examined by VxDs. The 
  layout allows for DOS to note the resource usage of as many as 20 TSRs that run 
  outside of Windows. Interestingly, VxDs do not have access to this record via 
  the int 21h function 1690h interface. The IOS VxD finds the record by knowing 
  that the address is kept as the dword at offset 1328h in the DOS kernel’s data 
  segment. The layout and location of this TSR record appear to be undocumented.
  </p>
  <p>Of particular interest to the CRTDRVR library is the method by which DOS takes 
  its snapshots of resources used by TSRs. Two routines have been added to the DOS 
  kernel. One takes the snapshot before a program runs. It is called every time 
  that int 21h function 4Bh is used to start a new process, but only provided Windows 
  Enhanced Mode is not running and only provided SYSINIT has given DOS the memory 
  in which to record the snapshot (that is, provided that the dword at offset 1328h 
  is not null). The other new routine acts when a program finishes. It compares 
  with the snapshot that was taken before the program runs, and it records what 
  has changed. It is called whenever a program terminates via int 21h function 31h 
  and Windows Enhanced Mode is not running. </p>
  <p>The problem for the CRTDRVR library is that whereas the first of those routines 
  takes its snapshot only if SYSINIT has provided the necessary memory, the second 
  routine simply <span class="emphasis">assumes</span> that the memory is there. 
  Specifically, it does not check that the dword at offset 1328h is not null. If 
  int 21h function 31h is used while SYSINIT is still in the business of loading 
  device drivers, then the DOS kernel’s pointer at offset 1328h will be null and 
  the DOS kernel will misbehave, possibly even by trampling over the interrupt vector 
  table. </p>
  <p>Note the inconsistency. One routine guards against a null pointer and the other 
  doesn’t—even though the routines are adjacent in the kernel code. The understandable 
  difference from Microsoft’s perspective is that int 21h function 4Bh is needed 
  while SYSINIT loads device drivers and must guard against a null pointer, but 
  int 21h function 31h is not anticipated to be used this early and therefore need 
  not guard against a null pointer. </p>
  <p>The updated CRTDRVR code works around this problem by providing the DOS kernel 
  with the necessary memory temporarily. The new code is enabled only when running 
  under DOS version 7.0 or higher. </p>
  <p>A first update in 1996 was either too optimistic (thinking that future versions 
  of the DOS kernel would guard against the null pointer) or too pessimistic (thinking 
  that there would be no future version), and tested for DOS 7.0 exactly. I thank 
  Ivan P. de Arruda Campos for bringing to my attention a problem that had this 
  test as its cause. </p>
  <h3>… But an FCB-SFT Is No Longer Needed </h3>
  <p>For DOS versions before Windows 95, CRTDRVR already has to work around a similar 
  problem in the DOS kernel code, namely that when terminating a process, the DOS 
  kernel simply <span class="emphasis">assumes</span> the existence of at least 
  one FCB-SFT. Since the FCB-SFTs are not built until SYSINIT finishes loading device 
  drivers, all functions for terminating DOS processes are unsafe during device 
  driver initialisation. To get around this, the CRTDRVR code presented in
  <span class="citation">DOS Internals</span> provides the DOS kernel with a temporary 
  FCB-SFT. </p>
  <p>Under Windows 95, Microsoft needs to execute an ordinary program during DOS’s 
  startup, specifically a program bound into the IO.SYS file and used for reading 
  the system registry. This ordinary program will terminate in the ordinary way. 
  Since Microsoft now needs to run a program during DOS’s startup and have the program 
  terminate safely, it is no surprise to find that when the DOS kernel for Windows 
  95 terminates a process, it now checks whether SYSINIT has yet provided a block 
  of FCB-SFTs. Thus, the FCB-SFT workaround need not be activated when the CRTDRVR 
  code executes under DOS 7 (or higher). </p>
  <h2>Download </h2>
  <p>The revisions described above mean that three files must be replaced in the 
  DEVTOOLS\DRIVER\CRTDRVR directory of the <span class="citation">DOS Internals</span> 
  disk. These files are the CRTDRVR assembly-language source, the object code and 
  the library. The CRTDRVR.LIB file should also be copied to the LIB directory. 
  For distribution, all three files are compressed into one:
