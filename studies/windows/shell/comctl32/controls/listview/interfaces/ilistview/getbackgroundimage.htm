<h1>GetBackgroundImage </h1>
<p>This method of the <span class="interface"><a href="index.htm">IListView</a></span> 
interface queries a List-View control for information about its background image 
or watermark. </p>
<h2>Declaration </h2>
<pre class="source">HRESULT GetBackgroundImage (LVBKIMAGEW *plvbki);</pre>
<h3>Parameters </h3>
<p>The <span class="argument">plvbki</span> argument is the address of an
<span class="struct"><a href="../../structures/lvbkimage.htm">LVBKIMAGEW</a></span> 
structure that specifies what information is desired and receives whatever 
information is produced. </p>
<h3>Return Value </h3>
<!--webbot bot="Include" U-Include="../_include/hresult.htm" TAG="BODY" startspan -->

<p>The method returns zero for success, else an error code. </p>

<!--webbot bot="Include" i-checksum="37727" endspan -->
<!--webbot bot="Include" U-Include="_include/e_fail.htm" TAG="BODY" startspan -->

<p>Except where noted to the contrary, the error code is
<span class="constant">E_FAIL</span>. </p>

<!--webbot bot="Include" i-checksum="3188" endspan -->
<h2>Behaviour </h2>
<!--webbot bot="Include" U-Include="_include/createdestroy.htm" TAG="BODY" startspan -->

<p>The method fails, returning <span class="constant">E_UNEXPECTED</span>, if 
the List-View control has not yet received its <span class="message">WM_CREATE</span> 
message or has already received a <span class="message">WM_DESTROY</span> 
message.
</p>

<!--webbot bot="Include" i-checksum="20458" endspan -->
<p>The method also fails if given NULL for the <span class="argument">plvbki</span> 
argument. Otherwise, <span class="argument">plvbki</span> is taken as addressing 
an <span class="struct">LVBKIMAGEW</span> structure. </p>
<!--webbot bot="Include" U-Include="_include/bkiorwm.htm" TAG="BODY" startspan -->

<p>A List-View control can have simultaneously both a background image and a 
watermark. Though only one or the other is displayed at any one time (the 
background image having precedence), they can be set and cleared independently. 
Whether the method operates on the background image or the watermark depends on 
the
<span class="constant">LVBKIF_TYPE_WATERMARK</span> bit in the
<span class="member">ulFlags</span> member on input. </p>

<!--webbot bot="Include" i-checksum="25224" endspan -->
<h3>Watermark </h3>
<p>If <span class="constant">LVBKIF_TYPE_WATERMARK</span> bit is set on input, 
the method is a request for the watermark only. The method always succeeds in 
this case. Nothing else is meaningful in the input. The only meaningful member 
on output is
<span class="member">hbm</span>, which returns a bitmap handle for the 
watermark, else NULL if there is no watermark. </p>
<h3>Background Image </h3>
<p>With <span class="constant">LVBKIF_TYPE_WATERMARK</span> clear on input, the 
method is a request for information about the (ordinary) background image. Other 
members that can be meaningful on input are <span class="member">pszImage</span> 
and <span class="member">cchImageMax</span>. In the output, the
<span class="member">ulFlags</span> bits masked by <span class="constant">
LVBKIF_SOURCE_MASK</span> 
are always meaningful since they indicate which type, if any, of background 
image is currently set for the control. </p>
<p>If the control has no background image, the method succeeds and the source 
bits in the returned <span class="member">ulFlags</span> are <span class="constant">
LVBKIF_SOURCE_NONE</span>. Other flags and members may change from their input 
values but are perhaps best regarded as meaningless. </p>
<p>If the background image is known as a bitmap handle, the method succeeds, the 
source bits in the returned <span class="member">ulFlags</span> are
<span class="constant">LVBKIF_SOURCE_HBITMAP</span>, and the bitmap handle is 
returned in <span class="member">hbm</span>. </p>
<p>If the background image is known as a URL, the source bits in the returned
<span class="member">ulFlags</span> are <span class="constant">LVBKIF_SOURCE_URL</span>. 
The <span class="member">pszImage</span> and <span class="member">cchImageMax</span> 
members given as input provide the address and size (in characters) of a buffer 
for receiving the URL as a Unicode string. The method fails if the given
<span class="member">pszImage</span> member is NULL. Otherwise, the method 
succeeds, after filling the given buffer with as many characters of the URL as 
will fit. It is unclear how meaningful can be the returned URL if the buffer 
turns out to be too small to receive the whole URL. </p>
<p>Whether the background image is known by a bitmap handle or a URL, the 
following other flags and members in the output are meaningful for describing 
style and placement: the <span class="constant">LVBKIF_STYLE_MASK</span> and <span class="constant">
LVBKIF_FLAG_TILEOFFSET</span> 
fields in <span class="member">ulFlags</span>, and the <span class="member">
xOffsetPercent</span> 
and <span class="member">yOffsetPercent</span> members. </p>
<h4>Coding Errors or Quirks </h4>
<p>If the method succeeds with <span class="constant">LVBKIF_SOURCE_HBITMAP</span> 
as the source bits in the returned <span class="member">ulFlags</span>, it is 
possible that <span class="member">hbm</span> in the output is NULL. This is a 
true indication that the control has no bitmap handle for the background image, 
and indeed that it has no background image, though one might think this state 
would better be indicated by returning <span class="constant">LVBKIF_SOURCE_NONE</span> 
in the source bits. This state’s existence is here counted as a coding error 
since the state is produced by what looks like incomplete cleanup in <span class="method">
<a href="setbackgroundimage.htm">SetBackgroundImage</a></span>, as explained at 
length in the notes on that method. </p>
<h2>Availability </h2>
<p>The <span class="method">GetBackgroundImage</span> method of the
<span class="interface">IListView</span> interface is implemented by List-View 
controls in COMCTL32 versions 6.10 and higher. </p>
<p>In versions 4.71 and higher, the functionality of the <span class="method">
GetBackgroundImage</span> 
method is available through the windowing system, by sending the
<span class="message"><a href="../../messages/getbkimage.htm">LVM_GETBKIMAGE</a></span> 
message. </p>
