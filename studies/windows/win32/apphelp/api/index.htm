<h1>APPHELP Functions </h1>
<p>The table on this page lists all the functions that appear in the export directory 
of any known version of APPHELP.DLL. It gives for each function just brief summaries 
of the <a href="../history/index.htm">APPHELP versions</a> that export the function 
and of the function’s status with respect to Microsoft’s documentation. This master 
list is the key to other lists. More detail on each function’s availability and 
documentation status may be found by looking for the function in other lists according 
to the function’s first version. In the Table of Contents, expand the entry for 
APPHELP Versions to get the pages for each version. More explanatory notes follow 
the table. </p>

<h2>Names </h2>
<p>Function names are reproduced from the export directory of the APPHELP.DLL executable. 
All exports from APPHELP are by name, until version 6.2 (Windows 8) exports roughly 
30 by ordinal only. The names of functions that are exported only by ordinal are 
inferred from symbol files that Microsoft publishes for customer support. For such 
functions, the ordinal is given in brackets after the name. Beware that some functions 
are shown with two ordinals. </p>
<h2>Versions </h2>
<p>The APPHELP versions shown for each function are inferred from a study of public 
releases only. My holdings are incomplete and I anyway have no time for (or interest 
in) examining pre-release builds or hotfixes. Of necessity then, the table makes 
what I hope are reasonable assumptions about likely continuity, especially to suppose 
that a function will exist in future versions or that a function exists in all released 
builds of a version if no counter-example is yet known. If you want more accurate 
or comprehensive information, try getting it from Microsoft. </p>
<h2>Documentation Status </h2>
<p>To describe the information that is publicly available from Microsoft about APPHELP.DLL 
as thin seems perfectly fair. This is not to say there can’t be good reason for 
the information to be so thin, just that it is conspicuously thin—and, yes, to suggest 
that this is very much Microsoft’s intention. No Software Development Kit (SDK) 
that I have on disc and which in turn has documentation that can be searched on 
disc has any documentation of any APPHELP function other than
<span class="function">ApphelpCheckShellObject</span>. Among the headers in these 
SDKs, only this one function has a C-language declaration. Something conspicuous 
about this declaration is that the header, appcompatapi.h, defines a macro,
<span class="macro">SDBAPI</span>, for the calling convention of this one function. 
Apparently, there exists an API of SDB functions. A header, named shimdb.h, that 
is yet known only from a Windows Driver Kit (WDK) for Windows 10, has a
<span class="directive">#include</span> for an sdbapi.h which the kit omits. Release 
of shimdb.h and its disclosure that an sdapi.h exists seem likely to be oversights: 
after all, shimdb.h cannot be compiled while the included sdbapi.h is missing. Most 
plausibly, this missing header is where Microsoft declares the exported APPHELP 
functions whose names begin with Sdb—at least the documented ones. </p>
<p>A significant minority of this API of SDB functions is indeed documented. Except 
for <span class="function">ApphelpCheckShellObject</span>, however, all the functions 
that are marked above as documented seem to be documented only online, as with
<span class="function">
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/bb432431.aspx">SdbBeginWriteListTag</a></span> 
(which is here selected as the example only for being alphabetically first). Even 
as online-only documentation, it’s in a section of Archive Developer Notes as if 
the functions have historical interest only. Perhaps that’s all the interest they 
do have at Microsoft and should have to anyone else. Note in this context that where 
Microsoft provides an Application Compatibility Toolkit, it provides only ready-made 
tools that use the functionality, not headers and libraries that might help developers 
find innovatively different ways to use the functionality. </p>
<p>Such documentation as Microsoft does provide online has for all practical effect 
been frozen for a decade and may anyway have appeared only years after the functionality’s 
introduction. The functions that are documented are mostly concerned with SDB files. 
As the form in which Windows keeps its Application Compatibility Database, these 
files have been around since Windows 2000 SP3 and APPHELP itself dates from the 
original release of Windows XP in 2001. That the documentation was first made available 
as early as 2001 seems doubtful and may now be unknowable: the only date in the 
documentation as browsed now (in August 2016) is a copyright notice for 2016. The 
documentation certainly does cover functionality that was new for Windows Vista 
and some aspects of it (such as lists of tags that are defined for database items) 
are even complete for Windows Vista, but nothing that has been added to the APPHELP 
functionality since Windows Vista has made it to this documentation. If there have 
been updates to this documentation in the last ten years, even assuming the documentation 
was published contemporaneously with Windows Vista in 2006, they seem limited to 
a mechanical change of the style of annotations that Microsoft adds to function 
arguments to help its tools for static code analysis. </p>
<h2>Pre-History </h2>
<p>Though the late Windows 2000 service packs have SDB files, they have no APPHELP.DLL. 
The first exported functions for working with SDB files are found in an SDBAPIU.DLL. 
Except that SDBAPIU seems not to have been developed as a Windows component—see 
especially that its version numbering is not that of Windows—there seems to be very 
little reason not to regard SDBAPIU as an early APPHELP. The Microsoft Installer 
certainly does. Where its MSI.DLL, even as late as Windows 8, imports the SDB functions 
dynamically, it knows to look in SDBAPIU if not running on Windows XP or higher.
</p>
<p>The functions that are notated above as “earlier in SDBAPIU” are exported by 
name from the SDBAPIU that is known from both Windows 2000 SP3 and SP4. The three 
SDBAPIU exports that were not taken over by APPHELP are included too, but notated 
“only in SDBAPIU”. The others did not all pass to APPHELP immediately: many are 
not exported from APPHELP until a substantial increase for the build of version 
5.2 from Windows Server 2003 SP1. </p>
<p>A curiosity that is not yet resolved is that SDBAPIU has some sort of continued 
existence beyond what looks at first to have been its replacement by APPHELP. Though 
no SDBAPIU executable is known in Windows XP and higher, symbol files for one are 
contained in Microsoft’s packages of symbol files for Windows 7, Windows 8 and Windows 
8.1. </p>
<h2>Separate Existence </h2>
<p>Many of the functions that APPHELP exports—and many internal routines, too—are 
not written specifically for APPHELP but are instead incorporated into APPHELP from 
a statically linked library. This library is nowadays named simply sdbapi.lib. Before 
Windows 10, however, the library was named differently when built for user mode 
and kernel mode: sdbapil.lib and sdbapint.lib, respectively. </p>
<h3>Kernel Mode </h3>
<p>The kernel-mode use was designed from the start, with Windows XP recognising 
a particular SDB file named DRVMAIN.SDB as listing drivers that are blocked from 
being loaded. The file is loaded into memory by the loader and interpreted by the 
kernel (the address and size having been passed in the <span class="struct">
<a href="../../../km/ntoskrnl/structs/loader_parameter_extension.htm">LOADER_PARAMETER_EXTENSION</a></span>, 
via what were then the newly introduced <span class="member">DrvDBImage</span> and
<span class="member">DrvDBSize</span> members). Where these SDB functions are used 
by the kernel there is of course no hope of them being imported from the user-mode 
APPHELP. There is not a kernel-mode APPHELP to import from, either. They are internal 
routines and therefore not ordinarily the business of these lists in any mode. The 
historical interest, however, is hard to resist. More than a few functions that 
are eventually exported from APPHELP have an earlier history in the statically linked 
library. Where this history is particularly that the function exists also as an 
internal routine in the kernel, it is not shown in this page’s master list of APPHELP 
exports but may be followed among the Remarks in the separate lists of exports by 
version. </p>
<h3>User Mode </h3>
<p>Of the user-mode Windows components that need Application Compatibility functionality, 
surprisingly many get it not by importing from APPHELP but by having it in their 
own executable image via the statically linked library. Of course, it’s only to 
be expected that where some low-level DLL such as KERNEL32 wants to work with an 
SDB file it should have the code in its own binary rather than import from the relatively 
higher-level APPHELP. Why, though, something as seemingly high-level as GAMEUX.DLL 
for the Games Explorer carries code from the statically linked library instead of 
importing from APPHELP may be anyone’s guess. </p>
<h2>Delay-Load Failure Hook </h2>
<p>From the beginning, a selection of APPHELP exports are covered by the undocumented
<span class="function">DelayLoadFailureHook</span> function that has long been exported 
from KERNEL32 (in its version 5.0 and higher). This function is intended to extend 
the capability of the library code that Microsoft Visual Studio supplies (with source 
code) to support delay-loaded importing. The default behaviour of this library code 
is to throw an exception if the module to be imported from can’t be loaded or if 
the function that’s to be imported from that module isn’t exported by that module. 
The usual effect is to crash the program, if not completely brutally for lack of 
an exception handler then at least unpleasantly for it’s not as if a general-purpose 
exception handler can really do much about it. Programmers who don’t like to risk 
this from the default support can supply their own <span class="function">__delayLoadHelper2</span> 
routine, but a middle path is to extend the default by setting either or both of 
two pointers that are defined by the library but which are acted on only if they 
are not <span class="constant">NULL</span> when the library code is called to resolve 
a delay-loaded import. The <span class="function">DelayLoadFailureHook</span> function 
is suitable for setting into the <span class="variable">__pfnDliFailureHook2</span> 
pointer. It is acted on when the module to import is loaded but the function to 
import from it is not found. If the function is one of some thousands of Windows 
API functions, both well-known and not, from hundreds of DLLs, then the KERNEL32 
implementation of <span class="function">DelayLoadFailureHook</span> resolves the 
problem by returning the address of a stub that fails the function trivially. The 
importing module then gets to handle the failure of just the called function.
</p>
<p>Even for the first release of APPHELP, <span class="function">DelayLoadFailureHook</span> 
covers 11 APPHELP functions this way. Probably none were documented at the time. 
Hardly any have been documented since, and many more have been added to the coverage. 
This would not, of course, be the slightest bit remarkable were
<span class="function">DelayLoadFailureHook</span> exported only from KERNEL32 for 
use by other Windows components only. And it may be that the implementation in KERNEL32 
is just for other Windows components. However, KERNEL32 gets the code and data for 
its <span class="function">DelayLoadFailureHook</span> from a statically linked 
library, named dload.lib, which provides the same code and data for SHLWAPI to export
<span class="function">DelayLoadFailureHook</span> in its version 6.0 and higher 
(which, arguably confusingly, means Windows XP and higher). This SHLWAPI implementation 
is then imported (dynamically) by various components of Internet Explorer. For Windows 
Vista, a supposed separation of Internet Explorer from calling undocumented Windows 
API functions is handled by moving the same <span class="function">DelayLoadFailureHook</span> 
to the new IERTUTIL and renaming it to <span class="function">IERT_DelayLoadFailureHook 
function</span>. How Internet Explorer has this indirect knowledge of many undocumented 
APPHELP functions is not satisfactorily dismissed as being anyone’s guess. It ought 
instead to count to some regulator’s shame. The days were supposed to be long gone 
that Internet Explorer was written with any access to Windows functionality that 
Microsoft did not publish for use by competing browsers. </p>
<p>Again, the master list on this page cannot feasibly show the detail of which 
functions have delay-load support in which versions. For that, look through the 
separate lists of exports by version. It is not known what guides Microsoft’s choice.
