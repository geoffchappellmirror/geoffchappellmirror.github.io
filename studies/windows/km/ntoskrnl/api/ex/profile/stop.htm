<h1>NtStopProfile </h1>
<p>This function stops the profiling that has been configured for a given profile 
object. </p>
<h2>Declaration </h2>
<pre class="source">NTSTATUS NtStopProfile (HANDLE ProfileHandle);</pre>
<h3>Parameters </h3>
<!--webbot bot="Include" U-Include="_include/start_stop.htm" TAG="BODY" startspan -->

<p>The <span class="argument">ProfileHandle</span> argument is a handle to an
<a href="eprofile.htm">executive profile object</a>, such as created by
<span class="function"><a href="create.htm">NtCreateProfile</a></span> or
<span class="function"><a href="createex.htm">NtCreateProfileEx</a></span>.
</p>

<!--webbot bot="Include" endspan i-checksum="55698" -->
<h3>Return Value </h3>
<!--webbot bot="Include" U-Include="../../_include/ntstatus.htm" TAG="BODY" startspan -->

<p>The function returns <span class="constant">STATUS_SUCCESS</span> if successful, 
else a negative error code. </p>

<!--webbot bot="Include" endspan i-checksum="8" -->
<h2>Availability </h2>
<p>The <span class="function">NtStopProfile</span> function and its alias
<span class="function">ZwStopProfile</span> are exported by name from NTDLL in version 
3.10 and higher. In kernel mode, where <span class="function">ZwStopProfile</span> 
is a stub and <span class="function">NtStopProfile</span> is the implementation, 
neither is exported until the 1607 release of Windows 10 exports the stub. </p>
<h2>Documentation Status </h2>
<p>Neither <span class="function">NtStopProfile</span> nor its alias is documented. 
As <span class="function">ZwStopProfile</span>, it is declared in the ZWAPI.H file 
from an Enterprise edition of the Windows Driver Kit (WDK) for Windows 10. </p>
<p>Unusually for native API functions, no repackaging of <span class="function">
NtStopProfile</span>, documented or not, is known in any higher-level user-mode 
module that is distributed as standard with Windows. </p>
<h2>Behaviour </h2>
<!--webbot bot="Include" U-Include="../../_include/win10.htm" TAG="BODY" startspan -->

<p>The following implementation notes come mainly from inspection of the kernel 
from the original release of Windows 10. They may some day get revised to account 
for other versions. Where anything is written about earlier versions, take it not 
as an attempt at presenting a comprehensive history but as a bonus from my being 
unable to resist a quick trip down memory lane. I have no programme of revisiting 
this analysis for later releases. Updates mean just that I happen to have noticed 
something and to have found time to add it. </p>

<h3>Parameter Validation </h3>
<p>The function fails unless the given handle references an executive profile object 
(rather than any other type of object) and has whatever permission is represented 
by the access mask 0x00000001. Microsoft’s name for this one permission that is 
defined for profile objects is not known, but there would be no surprise if it turns 
out to be <span class="struct">EPROFILE</span>. </p>
<p>The profile object retains parameters that were supplied on some earlier call 
to <span class="function">NtCreateProfile</span> or <span class="function">NtCreateProfileEx</span>. 
Among these is the address of a buffer that is to receive the <span class="type">
ULONG</span> counters of times that execution is discovered in successive buckets 
that span a profiled region of address space. Because the counters will be incremented 
while handling a hardware interrupt this buffer—well, that part of it that will 
be needed for the counters—must be locked into physical memory and mapped into system 
address space at all times that profiling is started but not yet stopped. This mapped 
address for the buffer is also kept with the profile object. If it’s not present, 
then there is no profiling to stop, and the function returns
<span class="constant">STATUS_PROFILING_NOT_STARTED</span>. </p>
<h3>Cleanup </h3>
<p>The function’s remaining work, which cannot fail, is to stop the profiling but 
not to end it. It undoes just the work of <span class="function">
<a href="start.htm">NtStartProfile</a></span>. The executive profile object remains. 
The caller retains a handle to it and may reuse it in any number of paired calls 
to <span class="function">NtStartProfile</span> and <span class="function">NtStopProfile</span>. 
Complete cleanup is done only when the handle gets closed. </p>
