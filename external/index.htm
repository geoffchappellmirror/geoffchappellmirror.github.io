  <h1>External Publication </h1>
  <p>Much of the point to having one’s own website is to have full control over 
  the content and presentation. Importantly, I have no editor or publisher to answer 
  to. It’s not that my experience with editors is bad. Neither is it with publishers, 
  but publishers tend not to think they are in the business of funding research—which 
  indeed they aren’t. </p>
  <p>Publishers pay for a brain-dump, at best for expression and even insight, but 
  not for the research itself. While there’s truth to the notion that information 
  wants to be free, anyone whose business is the digging up of information knows 
  what very hard work it can be. Though I don’t doubt that publishing also is work, 
  I decided in 1997 that since the research counts for so little in the minds of 
  publishers, the writing that only exists because of the research would better 
  not be profit for the publisher. </p>
  <p>The big liberation for self-publishing back in the late 90s was, of course, 
  the Internet. Anyone can get pages hosted at an HTTP server and perhaps even gain 
  a readership. That’s also not without its problems, of course. There’s an awful 
  lot of crud out there on the Internet, both self-published and not. I can’t do 
  much about that except to be my own sharpest critic so that my own work is not 
  counted as crud. Frequently cited websites that nobody thinks of as self-published 
  might do better to aim similarly. </p>
  <p>Thus did it come about that for very nearly two decades I published to nowhere 
  but my own website. Even now, there are only very few exceptions. </p>
  <h2>Archive </h2>
  <p>But let’s start chronologically. My very first professional writing on computer 
  programming looks to be completely absent from the Internet and perhaps never 
  was available on the Internet. It’s a book review that I wrote in 1991 for a British 
  magazine which is long, long gone: </p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="spreadingsecrets.htm">Spreading Secrets</a> first published in 
    <span class="citation">.EXE</span> magazine, Volume 5, Issue 10, 
    April 1991. </li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Articles </h2>
  <p>In 2016 and 2017, I wrote two articles expressly for
  <a href="pocorgtfo.htm">Poc||GTFO</a>, which I now reproduce at this website:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="../studies/windows/win32/apphelp/sdb/shimdbc.htm">Where is ShimDBC.exe?</a> 
    first published as
    <a href="https://www.alchemistowl.org/pocorgtfo/pocorgtfo13.pdf">PoC||GTFO 13:9</a>
    </li>
    <li><a href="../notes/security/cpl/index.htm">Control Panel Vulnerabilities</a> 
    first published as
    <a href="https://www.alchemistowl.org/pocorgtfo/pocorgtfo14.pdf">PoC||GTFO 14:8</a>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Conferences </h2>
  <p>I’m also not one for attending conferences. The days in attendance, or even 
  just in travel, are days not spent either on research or on the paid work that 
  sponsors the research. Such time looks first and foremost like time lost. There 
  surely is something to gain socially or for self-promotion, perhaps even for advertising 
  the paid work or encouraging a sponsor, but I am not naturally a networker. Worse, 
  what would I ever speak about? The nature of these conferences is that the speaker 
  revisits old work. I have no end of new work to get on with. Putting more time 
  into research will always win. </p>
  <p>Still, I was persuaded to speak at SummerCon 2017. Had it not been in Brooklyn—so 
  close and yet so far—I surely would have declined. I’m glad I didn’t, for I thoroughly 
  enjoyed myself, not least because of the organisers’ hard work and attention. 
  For better or worse, here are the slides that I ad-libbed from: </p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="summercon2017.pptx">A Programmer’s Perspective on Reverse Engineering</a>
