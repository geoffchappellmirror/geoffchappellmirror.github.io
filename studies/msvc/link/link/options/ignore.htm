<h1>LINK /IGNORE </h1>
<p>This option directs LINK to ignore the specified warnings. </p>
<!--webbot bot="Include" U-Include="../../_include/ignore-syntax.htm" TAG="BODY" startspan -->

<h2>Syntax </h2>
<blockquote>
  <p><span class="switch">/ignore:</span><span class="placeholder">warning</span>[[<span class="switch">,</span><span class="placeholder">warning</span>]...]<span class="switch">
  </span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>At least one argument is required. All arguments must be numbers between 4000 
and 4999 inclusive. It is a fatal error (LNK1147) if any argument does not evaluate 
satisfactorily. </p>

<!--webbot bot="Include" i-checksum="45171" endspan -->
<p>The <span class="switch">/ignore</span> option is for the command line only. 
It is not valid as a directive in an object file. </p>
<!--webbot bot="Include" U-Include="../../_include/ignore-behaviour.htm" TAG="BODY" startspan -->

<h2>Behaviour </h2>
<p>In general, each of the specified warnings gets registered to be ignored. This 
means that should it occur, for whatever reason in whatever circumstances subsequent 
to the processing of this option, there will be no warning message and neither will 
its occurrence be treated as an error if the <span class="switch">/wx</span> option 
is active. </p>
<h3>Unignorable Warnings </h3>
<p>Some warning numbers are apparently too important to ignore: </p>

    <td>LNK4228 </td>
    <td>&#39;/%S&#39; invalid for a DLL; ignored </td>

<p>To specify any of these in a <span class="switch">/ignore</span> option is not 
an error and brings no complaint. The specification is just not acted on. Should 
the specified warning ever occur, a warning message will still be displayed, and 
if the <span class="switch">/wx</span> option is active, the warning will still 
be promoted to an error. </p>
<h4>Coding Error </h4>
<p>As an aside, whichever of Microsoft’s programmers is currently in charge of LINK.EXE 
may care to note a small, presently inconsequential, coding error in the function 
that registers a warning number to be ignored. The unignorable warning numbers are 
defined as an array, with 12 members. In the loop that checks whether a warning 
number is in this array (and therefore not to be registered), the loop index presently 
runs to 48, i.e., to the <span class="keyword">sizeof</span> the relevant array 
rather than to the number of elements in that array. </p>

<!--webbot bot="Include" i-checksum="50666" endspan -->
<h3>Not Quite Unignorable Warnings </h3>
<p>For some warning numbers, specification in a <span class="switch">/ignore</span> 
option is accepted but not necessarily acted upon. Should the warning occur 
while the <span class="switch">/wx</span> option is not active, then the warning 
message is still displayed, but if the <span class="switch">/wx</span> option is 
active, then the warning is ignored. It is as if the warning is thought 
important enough to override an attempt at ignoring it, but not if the user has 
put too high a price on unignored warnings. </p>
<p>The following warning numbers are affected: </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>4200, 4203, 4204, 4205, 4206, 4207, 4208, 4209, 4219, 4231 and 4237 </p>
</blockquote>
<p>but note that 4208 can also occur in circumstances such that it is ignored 
independently of <span class="switch">/wx</span>. </p>
<h3>Implicitly Ignored Warnings </h3>
<p>There is presently one case of a warning being set to be ignored without the 
corresponding <span class="switch">/ignore</span> option being given explicitly. 
A side-effect of <span class="switch">/subsystem:xbox</span> is that warning 
4078 gets registered internally as an ignored warning. </p>

<h2>Comment </h2>
<p>For who knows what reason, this obviously convenient switch is apparently undocumented. 
A corresponding switch for the compiler, <span class="switch">/wd</span>, has long 
been documented, as has a pragma for use in source code. </p>
<p>Though the <span class="switch">/ignore</span> switch may be undocumented, Microsoft 
has used it in the master makefiles for DDKs as far back as for NT 4.0. The warnings 
that Microsoft has found it necessary, or at least convenient, to disable in at 
least some cases when building device drivers over several DDK versions are: </p>
