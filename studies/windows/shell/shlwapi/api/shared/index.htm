<h1>Shared Memory </h1>
<p>From version 4.71 onwards, SHLWAPI provides a set of functions for sharing 
memory among processes: </p>
<ul>
  <li><span class="settlement function"><a href="alloc.htm">SHAllocShared</a></span>
  </li>
  <li><span class="settlement function"><a href="free.htm">SHFreeShared</a></span>
  </li>
  <li><span class="settlement function"><a href="lock.htm">SHLockShared</a></span>
  </li>
  <li><span class="undocumented function"><a href="lockex.htm">SHLockSharedEx</a></span> 
  (version 6.00) </li>
  <li><span class="undocumented function"><a href="maphandle.htm">SHMapHandle</a></span>
  </li>
  <li><span class="settlement function"><a href="unlock.htm">SHUnlockShared</a></span>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>The facility may have been intended originally just for transferring data 
from the address space of one process (the source) to that of another process 
(the target), and this seems the kindest interpretation of what may be intended 
by Microsoft’s documentation. However, the model generalises readily. </p>
<p>Of the processes that are to participate in the sharing, identify one as the 
originating process and one as a reference process. The originating process and 
reference process may be the same. The originating process, armed with a 32-bit 
process identifier (PID) for the reference process, calls <span class="function">
SHAllocShared</span> to create a shared memory area and, optionally, to copy 
data into it. The result is a handle in the context of the reference process. 
Thereafter, the shared memory area is represented by the combination of the 
handle and the PID for the reference process. </p>
<p>Any process that knows the handle and the reference PID may call
<span class="function">SHLockShared</span> or <span class="function">
SHLockSharedEx</span> 
to get the shared memory mapped into that process’s address space. The pointer 
so obtained remains valid for that process’s access to the shared memory area 
until the process passes the pointer to <span class="function">SHUnlockShared</span>. 
Any process that knows the handle and the reference PID may call
<span class="function">SHFreeShared</span> to ask that the shared memory area be 
destroyed when all its mappings into address spaces have eventually been 
released.
</p>
<p>Within SHLWAPI, the <span class="function">SHMapHandle</span> function is 
just a helper for the others, but it is exported and could be used generally for 
duplicating a handle from one process into another when both processes are known 
by PID. </p>
<p>The original five were first implemented in the NT releases of SHELL32 
version 4.00 in 1996, but with <span class="function">SHMapHandle</span> left as 
internal (i.e., not exported). They were relocated to SHLWAPI for version 4.71 
in 1997. It is as exports from SHELL32 that these functions remain most easily 
accessible, given that Microsoft eventually documented them as
<a target="_top" href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms807073.aspx">
Settlement Program Interfaces</a> in 2002 and has recently arranged that these 
newly documented functions be exported from SHELL32 by name. </p>
