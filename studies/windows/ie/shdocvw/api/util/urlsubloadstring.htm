<h1>URLSubLoadString </h1>
<p>This function loads a URL as a resource string and resolves various substitutable 
parameters. </p>
<h2>Declaration </h2>
<pre class="source">HRESULT 
URLSubLoadString (
    HINSTANCE hInstance, 
    UINT uID, 
    PWSTR lpBuffer, 
    DWORD cchBuffer, 
    DWORD dwFlags);</pre>
<h3>Parameters </h3>
<p>The <span class="argument">hInstance</span> argument provides the handle to an 
instance of the module from which to load the resource string, or is NULL to load 
from SHDOCVW’s or IEFRAME’s resources. </p>
<p>The <span class="argument">uID</span> argument provides the integer identifier 
of the desired resource string. </p>
<p>The <span class="argument">lpBuffer</span> and <span class="argument">cchBuffer</span> 
arguments describe a buffer (by address and capacity in Unicode characters, respectively) 
that is to receive the processed string. </p>
<p>The <span class="argument">dwFlags</span> argument provides bit flags that specify 
the desired <a href="sub.htm">URL substitutions</a>. </p>
<h3>Return Value </h3>
<!--webbot bot="Include" U-Include="../_include/hresult.htm" TAG="BODY" startspan -->

<p>The function returns zero for success, else an error code. </p>

<!--webbot bot="Include" i-checksum="1551" endspan -->
<h2>Behaviour </h2>
<p>The function loads the indicated resource string into a buffer on the stack, 
resolves the indicated substitutable parameters, and copies the result to the given 
buffer. </p>
<p>Failure to load the resource string is failure for the function. The error code 
is <span class="constant">E_FAIL</span>. For loading the resource string and performing 
the substitutions, the function uses buffers on the stack with capacity for
<span class="constant">INTERNET_MAX_URL_LENGTH</span> (0x0824) characters. Exceeding 
this capacity while resolving substitutable parameters does not cause the function 
to fail: the function instead does what it can but with truncation, so that the 
results are perhaps better regarded as undefined (not that the function provides 
any formal indication that truncation has occurred). </p>
<h2 class="draft">Use by Microsoft </h2>
<p class="draft">The most conspicuous use of this function by Microsoft is the internal 
matter of where Internet Explorer navigates in response to selections from the browser’s 
main menu, especially for on-line help. The target URLs are configurable through 
the registry, but the defaults are loaded from SHDOCVW’s resources, using
<span class="function">URLSubLoadString</span>. </p>
<p class="draft">A less obvious use, not continued into Windows Vista, is by SHELL32, 
to support the Visit Gallery button in the New Desktop Item dialog. The URL for 
the Microsoft Desktop Gallery is in SHELL32’s resources and is loaded using
<span class="function">URLSubLoadString</span>. </p>
<h2>Availability </h2>
<p>The <span class="function">URLSubLoadString</span> function is exported from 
SHDOCVW as ordinal 138 in version 5.0 and higher. </p>
<p>An ANSI form of this function exists in SHDOCVW as early as version 4.71, but 
is not exported. This early form does not make a special case of
<span class="argument">hInstance</span> being NULL. </p>
<p>A very slightly different coding of this function exists in IEFRAME but is not 
exported. It seems to have this copy only because the browser’s code for handling
<span class="message">WM_COMMAND</span> messages has moved to IEFRAME from BROWSEUI. 
The implementation of <span class="function">URLSubLoadString</span> in SHDOCVW 
continues to be exported, but quick inspection of Microsoft’s symbol files for Windows 
Vista suggests that no Windows (or Internet Explorer) executable now imports the 
function. </p>
<!--webbot bot="Include" U-Include="../_include/retired601.htm" TAG="BODY" startspan -->

<p>SHDOCVW version 6.1 retires this function: it continues to be exported but only as a forward 
to SHUNIMPL for certain failure. </p>

<p>Though this function dates from as long ago as 1999, it was still not 
documented by Microsoft as late as the January 2007 edition of the Windows Vista 
Software Development Kit (SDK). </p>
