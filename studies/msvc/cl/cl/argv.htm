<h1>CL.EXE Command Line Parsing </h1>
<p>The parsing of command-line text into tokens varies slightly with the source 
of the text. The actual command line is parsed by the C Run-Time (CRT) Library, 
specifically by the <span class="function">__getmainargs</span> function in 
MSVCR70.DLL, according to Microsoft-specific C-language rules of parsing 
command-line arguments for a program’s <span class="function">main</span> 
function. Command-line contributions from environment variables and command 
files are parsed by the compiler’s own code, which acts similarly but not 
identically to the CRT. The main difference is that wildcard expansion is a CRT 
feature and applies only to tokens on the actual command line. </p>
<h2>White Space </h2>
<p>In general, command-line text is broken into tokens at each occurrence of 
white space. On the actual command line, the white-space characters are 
specifically spaces and tabs. For command-line text from environment variables 
and command files, white space is understood in the sense of the CRT function <span class="function">
_ismbcspace</span> 
(so that it also includes carriage-returns, new-lines and form-feeds). </p>
<h2>Quotes and Backslashes </h2>
<p>To allow white space within a parsed token, there is a facility for enclosure 
by double-quotes. The parsing treats both the double-quote and backslash as 
special characters. </p>
<p>Where a double-quote is preceded by an odd number of backslashes, it is a
<span class="definition">literal</span> double-quote. What passes into the token 
is one backslash for each whole pair of backslashes in the text, plus one 
double-quote.
</p>
<p>Where a double-quote is preceded by an even number of backslashes, including 
by none, it is non-literal. What passes into the token is again one backslash 
for each pair, but the double-quote is discarded except to signify that until 
the next non-literal double-quote (if any), white space does not terminate the 
token but is instead part of the token. The matching non-literal double-quote 
also is discarded.
</p>
<h2>Wildcard Expansion </h2>
<p>Tokens from the actual command line, but not from environment variables or 
command files, are subject to wildcard expansion. The eligible tokens are those 
that contain a * or ? but do not begin with a non-literal double-quote. Each 
such token is interpreted tentatively as a pathname. If at least some file is 
found to match the pathname, then the original token with wildcards is replaced 
by potentially many tokens, one for each matching file, none now containing 
wildcards. </p>
