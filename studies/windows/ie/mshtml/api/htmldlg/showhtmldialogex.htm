<h1>ShowHTMLDialogEx </h1>
<p>Creates a trusted dialog box from an HTML source. </p>
<h2>Declaration </h2>
<pre class="source">HRESULT
ShowHTMLDialogEx (
    HWND hwndParent,
    IMoniker *pMk,
    DWORD dwDialogFlags,
    VARIANT *pvarArgIn,
    PWSTR pchOptions,
    VARIANT *pvarArgOut);</pre>
<h3>Arguments </h3>
<p>The <span class="argument">hwndParent</span> argument is the handle of the 
window that is to be the dialog box’s parent window, else is NULL. </p>
<p>The <span class="argument">pMk</span> argument is the address of an
<span class="interface">IMoniker</span> interface for access to the HTML that is 
to be shown in the dialog box. </p>
<p>The <span class="argument">dwDialogFlags</span> argument is a combination of 
bit flags from the following table: </p>
<table class="Constants">
  <colgroup>
    <col class="Name"><col class="Constant">
  </colgroup>
  <tr>
    <td><span class="constant">HTMLDLG_NOUI</span> </td>
    <td>0x00000010 </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><span class="constant">HTMLDLG_MODAL</span> </td>
    <td>0x00000020 </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><span class="constant">HTMLDLG_MODELESS</span> </td>
    <td>0x00000040 </td>
  </tr>

    <td><span class="constant">HTMLDLG_PRINT_TEMPLATE</span> </td>

<p>The <span class="argument">pvarArgIn</span> argument is the address of a
<span class="struct">VARIANT</span> that describes input to the dialog box, else 
is NULL. The type of data that can be given as input is essentially arbitrary. 
If it passes to the dialog box, it becomes the dialog box’s <span class="property">
dialogArguments</span> property (or equivalently, <span class="property">
menuArguments</span>).
</p>
<p>The <span class="argument">pchOptions</span> argument is the address of a 
case-insensitive Unicode string that specifies the <a href="options.htm">dialog 
box styles</a>, else is NULL. </p>
<p>The <span class="argument">pvarArgOut</span> argument is an address at which 
the function is to store a <span class="struct">VARIANT</span> that describes 
output from the dialog box, else is NULL. If the <span class="constant">
HTMLDLG_MODELESS</span> 
flag is set, then the output is the dialog box’s <span class="object">window</span> 
object (specifically, its <span class="interface">IHTMLWindow2</span> 
interface). Otherwise, the function does not return until the dialog box is 
closed, and the output is whatever finished as the dialog box’s <span class="property">
returnValue</span> 
property. The type of data that can be received as output is essentially 
arbitrary.
</p>
<h3>Return Value </h3>
<!--webbot bot="Include" U-Include="../_include/hresult.htm" TAG="BODY" startspan -->

<p>The function returns zero for success, else an error code. </p>

<h2>Behaviour </h2>
<p>The <span class="function">ShowHTMLDialogEx</span> function is large and 
complex, with numerous interactions throughout MSHTML. Complete documentation 
may be beyond the resources of this site. However, at least one point must be 
noted if only because it might easily be missed by programmers who rely on the 
scant notes that Microsoft seems to think suffice. </p>
<p>Where Microsoft says simply that the <span class="function">ShowHTMLDialogEx</span> 
function creates a trusted dialog box, it is important to understand that what 
is trusted is the HTML that is to be rendered in the dialog box. The caller of 
this function is telling MSHTML that the document can do no harm and is not to 
be denied anything. Not only are the implications likely to be missed by 
programmers, but they seem to have been missed by Microsoft. Look particularly 
at the status bar in the dialog box. A trusted dialog box ordinarily does not 
have a status bar, on the reasonable grounds that the information in the status 
bar is not needed for assurance about security. However, if the status bar is 
enabled (through the options string), it will be seen that the information is 
not so much unnecessary as actually misleading. It helps nobody if the status 
bar shows a document as having come from the Restricted Sites zone, yet MSHTML 
has happily run scripts from the document and permitted anything else that the 
document has wanted. Note that the document is not just elevated to a highly 
trusted zone where its permissions are relaxed but still configurable. The 
dialog box host provides its own
<span class="interface">IInternetSecurityManager</span> interface which 
explicitly allows all URL actions if the dialog box is trusted. The only 
concession is that Java permissions are set to high. </p>
<p>Another point that seems more readily appreciable in Microsoft’s 
documentation only if you already know it as something to look for is that 
dialog-box trust is inherited. If the document in a trusted dialog box runs 
script that calls its
<span class="object">window</span> object’s <span class="method">showModalDialog</span> 
or <span class="method">showModelessDialog</span> method to create another 
dialog box, then this second dialog box is trusted also. </p>
<h2>Availability </h2>
<p>The <span class="function">ShowHTMLDialogEx</span> function is exported from 
MSHTML by name in versions 5.50 and higher. The function is documented, though 
somehow has Internet Explorer 4.0 listed as its minimum availability. </p>
<p>The Windows SDK provides a prototype in the MSHTMHST.H header file, but it is 
not immediately useful to programmers because the SDK does not supply any import 
library for resolving a natural call to the function. Instead, the SDK tells 
programmers to write some supporting code that uses <span class="function">
LoadLibrary</span> 
to load MSHTML.DLL, and <span class="function">GetProcAddress</span> to locate 
the function, and then the helpfully provided type <span class="type">
SHOWHTMLDIALOGEXFN</span> 
for an indirect call to the function. This is all plainly silly and anyone who 
anticipates doing this work more than once would obviously do better to
<a href="../implib.htm">synthesise the missing import library</a>. </p>
