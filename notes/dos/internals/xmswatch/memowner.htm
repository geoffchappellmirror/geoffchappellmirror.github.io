  <h1>No Owners Shown In Report </h1>
  <p>Where XMSWATCH describes the chain of XMS handlers, each handler is supposed 
  to be described not only by the address of its entry point but also by naming 
  the program or driver that contains this entry point. The code that finds this 
  name is the function named <span class="function">GetMemoryOwner</span> in the 
  MEMOWNER.C source file from Chapter 14. If XMSWATCH is resident, this same function 
  is also used to find a name for any program that is observed to ask for extended 
  memory. The code and everything that it uses must therefore be allocated to the 
  resident segments. </p>
  <p>Under the constraints of the old C compiler that was contemporaneous with
  <span class="citation">DOS Internals</span>, allocation to resident segments was 
  arranged by compiling with particular <span class="switch">/ND</span> and
  <span class="switch">/NT</span> command-line switches. This was set up for MEMOWNER.C 
  in the MAKEFILE for XMSWATCH. What was neglected however was that MEMOWNER.C gets 
  the operating system version from a variable, which needs also to be resident. 
  In the particular way that MEMOWNER.C was coded, the version variable will be 
  resident only if the source file is compiled with the symbol
  <span class="symbol">_MANUAL_UMBLINK_</span> defined. Without this done, XMSWATCH 
  reads a byte that may have nothing to do with XMSWATCH, but the only harm seems 
  to be that there may be no Owner cited anywhere in the reports. </p>
  <p>The dependence on that symbol looks to be an artefact of cutting and pasting 
  from related code in Chapter 4, which itself looks like it ought to have avoided 
  this dependence. It could certainly be improved on, but the easiest remedy is 
  to define the symbol at compile-time. This means replacing two files in the XMS\XMSWATCH 
  directory of the <span class="citation">DOS Internals</span> disk, namely the 
  MAKEFILE and the built executable. For distribution, these two files are compressed 
  into one: <a href="_download/xmswatch-update.zip">download the corrected XMSWATCH</a>.
