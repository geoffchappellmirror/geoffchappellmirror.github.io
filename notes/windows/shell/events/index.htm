  <h1>Shell Events </h1>
  <p>Windows Vista has a greatly expanded scheme of logging events for performance 
  monitoring and diagnostic analysis. The Windows Shell is a significant participant, 
  but this is typically hidden even from expert users. </p>
  <p>The most accessible event provider for the Windows Shell is
  <a href="core.htm">Microsoft-Windows-Shell-Core</a>. It receives contributions 
  from roughly a dozen different executables. Some of this provider’s possible events 
  are logged to the SQMLogger and some others are logged to the DiagLog and WdiContextLog. 
  The SQMLogger is an auto-logger session that is ordinarily started only if you 
  join the Customer Experience Improvement Program. The others are also auto-loggers, 
  especially for the
  <a href="../../../../studies/windows/km/ntoskrnl/api/wdi/index.htm">Windows Diagnostic 
  Infrastructure</a> (WDI). These logs are ordinarily configured to start automatically, 
  but you can disable them, as for any auto-logger, by using the Reliability and 
  Performance Monitor. To see all the possible events, you must either set up your 
  own logging session or contrive to get the Event Viewer to list the default channel 
  which Microsoft has provided for but seems to have decided ought not be fully 
  configured. </p>
  <p>All the Windows Shell executables have code for WPP Software Tracing. Some, 
  such as SHELL32.DLL, contribute to two trace providers. In turn, each provider 
  acts for multiple executables. As usual for WPP Software Tracing, these providers 
  are not configured for use with tools such as the Event Viewer. The data they 
  collect is arguably useful only to Microsoft’s own programmers who work on the 
  source code or at least have it available for reference. </p>
