  <h1>Hooking Disk Access </h1>
  <p>The disk-hooking sample is a set of source files (and the built executables) 
  supplied at present with no comment other than what you see here and in the source 
  code. The sources build four test rigs. These are: </p>
  <ol>
    <li>
    <p>A Windows 95 VSD called DISKHOOK.VXD. </p>
    <p>It hooks disk access underneath IOS.VXD on Windows 95 and higher. It loads 
    automatically if placed in the IOSUBSYS subdirectory of the Windows SYSTEM directory.
    </p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p>A Windows for Workgroups 3.11 VSD called DISKHOOK.D32. </p>
    <p>It hooks disk access underneath IOS.386 on Windows for Workgroups 3.11 only. 
    It loads automatically if placed in the SYSTEM subdirectory of the Windows installation.
    </p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p>A VxD called DISKHOOK.386. </p>
    <p>It hooks disk access between BLOCKDEV.386 and the FastDisk driver (typically 
    WDCTRL) or between IOS.386 or IOS.VXD and the port driver. This VxD is to be 
    loaded via a <span class="inikey">device</span> statement in SYSTEM.INI. It 
    is intended for Windows 3.10 and higher, but a VSD is clearly a superior solution 
    in later versions. </p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p>A DOS program called DISKHOOK.EXE. </p>
    <p>It hooks int 13h and then runs a command processor. Running the disk hooking 
    program before running Windows gives you a global int 13h hook. Running the 
    disk hooking program from a DOS Prompt inside Windows gives you a local int 
    13h hook. </p>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p>The action of each test rig is to modify the appearance of the first sector 
  on cylinder 0 head 1 of the first physical hard disk, a preset location having 
  been chosen so that the sample can concentrate mostly on the mechanics of intercepting 
  disk access. The particular location chosen for the sample usually stores a DOS 
  boot sector. If this is not true for your machine, do not run these test rigs. 
  The specific change to the appearance is to find the first occurrence of the word 
  “disk” in the sector (this word being very likely to appear in an error message 
  somewhere in the sector) and to toggle the case of some of the letters. The DOS 
  test rig toggles the case of the first two letters. The VxD test rigs toggle the 
  case of the last two letters. </p>
  <p>All VxD source code is written in assembly language using include files from 
  the Windows 95 DDK. For detailed expectations read the MAKEFILE in each directory.
  </p>
  <p>The Windows 95 and Windows for Workgroups 3.11 VSDs have the
  <span class="emphasis">same</span> source code (although they must be compiled 
  with different include files). Two of the source files involve small amounts of 
  conditional assembly. One reason is trivial, namely that the different VSD versions 
  have to check for their respective versions of the IOS. Another reason is that 
  only the Windows 95 VSD needs to support the <span class="constant">AEP_BOOT_COMPLETE</span> 
  function. </p>
  <p>Although the VSD source code is presented separately from the source code for 
  the DISKHOOK.386 version that works for Windows 3.10, it should be noted that 
  there is a strong correspondence between source files and procedures. Indeed, 
  the two versions of the PLAY.ASM source file can be matched very nearly line by 
  line. Port drivers supersede FastDisk drivers. The IOS supersedes BlockDev. VSDs, 
  which sit between the IOS and a port driver are a very natural development of 
  the sort of VxD that sits between BlockDev and a FastDisk driver. </p>
  <p>The trouble with that progression is that Microsoft didn’t document it very 
  much. Indeed, I expect that hooking 32-bit disk access underneath BlockDev on 
  Windows 3.10 and higher was very rare in commercial software. Nothing undocumented 
  is required when hooking VxD services to bend them to your will, but you need 
  a sense of adventure even to see the possibility, before needing a good understanding 
  of what you’re hooking into. The replacement of BlockDev by IOS formalised the 
  notion of passing disk I/O through a sequence of drivers on the way to one that 
  actually controls the hardware. For many VxD programmers, this will have been 
  the first opportunity for hooking disk I/O inside Windows. Yet to my knowledge 
  the existence of this support before Windows 95 never was documented by Microsoft.
