<h1>CL /Zs </h1>
<h2>Syntax </h2>
<p>This option has no arguments. It is <span class="switch">/Zs</span> only. </p>
<h3>Relations </h3>
<p>The <span class="switch">/Zs</span> option weakly overrides
<span class="switch"><a href="g$m.htm">/Gm</a></span>. It does not pass to any compiler 
module. </p>
<h2>Behaviour </h2>
<p>The <span class="switch">/Zs</span> option leaves only the front-end C and C++ 
compilers as active. It disables all the remaining build stages: namely, Processing, 
Generating Code and Linking (though Processing can later be enabled by following 
with <span class="switch"><a href="b1_5.htm">/B1_5</a></span>). </p>
<p>Since the option is not passed to any compiler modules, its sole action is to 
constrain the build to the front-end C and C++ compilers. What they do for the build 
is exactly whatever they would have done had <span class="switch">/Zs</span> not 
been given. In most practical cases, the front-end compilers produce as output files 
only the so-called intermediate files that are the main communication to the back 
end (for code generation), and these files are deleted by CL after the build. The 
only lasting effect of <span class="switch">/Zs</span> is therefore to have found 
what errors and warnings would otherwise have been produced by the front-end compilers, 
given whatever other options are specified. Put another way, the
<span class="switch">/Zs</span> option limits compilation to a syntax check of the 
C and C++ source files. </p>
<p>Remember however that the front-end compilers do not know whether
<span class="switch">/Zs</span> has been given. Whatever intermediate files that 
they produce are exactly as they would have been without the
<span class="switch">/Zs</span> option. If <span class="switch">
<a href="b$k.htm">/Bk</a></span> is also given, then CL does not delete the intermediate 
files and the build can be resumed by re-running CL with <span class="switch">
<a href="bk.htm">/BK</a></span>. </p>
<p>If other options cause front-end compilation to produce output files, then these 
too will be exactly the same with or without the <span class="switch">/Zs</span> 
option. For example, if <span class="switch"><a href="f$x.htm">/Fx</a></span> is 
given with <span class="switch">/Zs</span>, then the “syntax check” still produces 
whatever .MRG file would have resulted from full compilation. The same applies to 
other output such as PCH and PDB files. </p>
