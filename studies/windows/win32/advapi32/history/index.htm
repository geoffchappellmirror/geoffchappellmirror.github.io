<h1>ADVAPI32 Versions </h1>
<p>Only in the NT versions of Windows is ADVAPI32.DLL fully functional. Client and 
server editions were separated for versions 5.1 and 5.2 before being reunited 
for version 6.0. </p>
<p>For the versions of Windows that run on MS-DOS, ADVAPI32 is significantly smaller 
and much less capable, enough that it might more usefully be considered a different 
executable. Still, this survey tries to keep them all together. Version 4.0 is common 
to both Windows products, but the Windows that runs on DOS never gets past 4 as 
its major version number. Beware, however, that ADVAPI32’s minor version numbers 
in that series differ from those of NTDLL and KERNEL32. </p>

<p>The version numbering gets arguably quirky for Windows 7, Windows 8 and Windows 
8.1. These were each in their time promoted as a significant—even major—release, 
yet they all have the same major version number which anyway isn’t in any of the 
names. As if to acknowledge this as unsatisfactory, the major version number for 
Windows 10 actually is 10. </p>
<h2>Builds </h2>
<!--webbot bot="Include" U-Include="../../_include/builds.htm" TAG="BODY" startspan -->

<p>The following builds have been inspected for these notes. Most are from MSDN 
discs. Some, especially since Microsoft greatly reduced its shipment of operating 
systems on MSDN discs, are from service packs downloaded (typically as self-extracting 
executables) from a Microsoft website. </p>
<p>Builds are arranged in increasing order of the file version as recorded in the 
executable’s resources. This version number is readily visible using Windows Explorer 
either in a so-called infotip for the file or by accessing the Version tab in the 
Properties dialog for the file. Programmers know this version number as coming from 
the so-called root block of the version-information resource, specifically from 
the <span class="member">dwFileVersionMS</span> and <span class="member">dwFileVersionLS</span> 
members of a <span class="struct">VS_FIXEDFILEINFO</span> structure. </p>
<p>The date stamp shown for each version is more obscure. File dates are easily 
modified after the executable is built and are anyway liable to be shown differently 
when read from different time zones. However, there is in each executable’s header 
a date stamp which is set when the executable is built and which is not commonly 
changed afterwards. It is readily accessible to anyone with programming knowledge 
and appropriate tools, e.g., Microsoft’s own DUMPBIN utility. </p>

<h3>64-Bit Windows </h3>
<!--webbot bot="Include" U-Include="../../_include/builds64.htm" TAG="BODY" startspan -->

<p>Microsoft’s distribution of early 64-bit Windows on MSDN discs is even less reliable 
than is my renewal of subscriptions. I seem never to have received a 64-bit edition 
of Windows XP. Since a subscription in 2007 produced no x64 build of the original 
Windows Vista, the copy inspected of that is from an OEM disc. The builds inspected 
for service packs are from self-extracting executables that have been downloaded 
from a free Microsoft website (which is, curiously, an order of magnitude faster 
than downloading disc images from the paid MSDN website). </p>
