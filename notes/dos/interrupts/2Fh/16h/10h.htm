  <h1>Interrupt 2Fh Function 1610h </h1>
  <p>This function was the original means of revealing the entry point for calling 
  functions defined by the eXtended Memory Specification (XMS). It was superseded 
  by <span class="instruction">int 2Fh</span> function 4310h as long ago as 1988.
  </p>
  <p>No implementation is known to have been formally released. Rumour has long 
  attributed the implementation to early builds of HIMEM.SYS, but the first known 
  release—for Windows/286 version 2.10, dated 1st July 1988, and reporting as XMS 
  version 1.11—already implements <span class="instruction">int 2Fh</span> function 
  43h, not 16h. Source code that Microsoft published for early builds of HIMEM.SYS 
  version 2.<span class="placeholder">xx</span> has a comment “Changed INT 2F multiplex 
  number to 43h” for version 1.11 on 23rd June 1988 but does not say what the number 
  changed from. </p>
  <p>These notes are inferred from the only known user, which is KERNEL.EXE from 
  Windows/286 version 2.10, specifically. The function is called only from deep 
  within a routine that computes how KERNEL uses expanded memory. The routine’s 
  only interest in the function is that less memory is sought if the High Memory 
  Area (HMA) exists. If <span class="instruction">int 2Fh</span> function 1600h 
  returns 80h in <span class="register">al</span>, then the HMA is inferred to be 
  under XMS management and its existence is determined by whether it can be allocated 
  and freed by calling the corresponding XMS functions. The address to call is learnt 
  from <span class="instruction">int 2Fh</span> function 1610h. If instead
  <span class="instruction">int 2Fh</span> function 1600h returns any other non-zero
  <span class="register">al</span>, then the Virtual DOS Machine Manager (VDMM) 
  is present and the HMA’s existence is taken as granted. If
  <span class="instruction">int 2Fh</span> function 1600h leaves al as zero, then 
  the HMA is treated as non-existent. </p>
  <p>Even this one use by the KERNEL from Windows/286 version 2.10 is plausibly 
  vestigial, as if the function number was meant to have been changed from 16h to 
  43h, and mostly was, except in this one routine. </p>
  <h2>Parameters </h2>
  <p>The function uses registers for both input and output. </p>
  <h3>Input </h3>
  <table>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td><span class="register">ax</span> </td>
        <td>1610h </td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
  <h3>Success </h3>
  <table>
    <tbody>
      <tr>
        <td><span class="register">es</span>:<span class="register">bx</span>
        </td>
        <td>address of XMS entry point </td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
  <p>The XMS entry point is to be called as if by a far
  <span class="instruction">call</span>. A function number is expected in
  <span class="register">ah</span>. Interpretation of other registers, both for 
  input and output, depends on the function number. </p>
  <h2>XMS Entry Point </h2>
  <p>The known implementation uses only two functions: 01h and 02h. Their use looks 
  to be consistent with implementations in HIMEM.SYS version 1.11 and higher, such 
  that they allocate and free the High Memory Area (HMA), respectively. XMS function 
  01h is treated as succeeding only if it returns with <span class="register">ax</span> 
  non-zero. No output is expected of XMS function 02h. </p>
