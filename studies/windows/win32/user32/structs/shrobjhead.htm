<h1>SHROBJHEAD </h1>
<p>The <span class="struct">SHROBJHEAD</span> structure is a common header for user 
objects that can be in shared memory. It is not known before version 4.0. It appears 
to have been superseded by a rearrangement for version 5.0. </p>
<h2>Documentation Status </h2>
<p>The <span class="struct">SHROBJHEAD</span> is not documented. Microsoft’s name 
for it is known only because tables for the <span class="command">!dso</span> command 
as implemented by the USEREXTS debugger extension from the Device Driver Kit (DDK) 
for Windows NT 4.0 show that the <span class="struct"><a href="procobjhead.htm">
PROCOBJHEAD</a></span> and <span class="struct"><a href="throbjhead.htm">THROBJHEAD</a></span> 
each have an unnamed <span class="struct">SHROBJHEAD</span> as their first member.
</p>
<h2>Layout </h2>
<p>The <span class="struct">SHROBJHEAD</span> is 0x10 bytes. </p>

<p>See also that <span class="member">rpdesk</span> and <span class="member">pSelf</span> 
are kernel-mode addresses. The <span class="struct">DESKTOP</span> that is pointed 
to from the object’s <span class="member">rpdesk</span> is not visible in user mode, 
but the object itself is visible in user mode in all processes that share the desktop. 
Of course, the object may—indeed, typically will—have a different user-mode address 
in each such process. So too may structures that are pointed to from the object. 
All such pointers hold kernel-mode addresses too. By themselves they are equally 
meaningless to user-mode code in all processes. The key to interpreting them is 
that <span class="member">pSelf</span> is a kernel-mode address of the object itself. 
Each process has its user-mode address for the object. Their difference can then 
be applied to other kernel-mode addresses (of anything in the same view) to convert 
them to user-mode addresses for that process. </p>
