  <h1>The Credibility of Documented Availability </h1>
  <p>For the vast majority of <a href="../api/index.htm">Windows Kernel Exports</a>, 
  Microsoft either lies about the applicable versions or says nothing. </p>
  <p>Though saying nothing is unhelpful, it seems the less unethical and it anyway 
  was readily understandable in the early years as natural neglect: not until version 
  4.0 does the kernel trouble to export any sort of function that tells drivers 
  which Windows version they’re running on. Early Device Driver Kit (DDK) documentation 
  only rarely mentions any Windows version other than the one the kit was prepared 
  for, so much so that the DDK for Windows XP stood out for what would otherwise 
  have been routine promotion of new functionality as new for Windows XP. </p>
  <p>The first big change from mostly saying nothing was not in the documentation 
  but in the declarations. The Windows Driver Kit (WDK) for Windows Vista, with 
  headers dated 2nd November 2006, wrapped many declarations in conditional compilation 
  blocks such that functions are exposed for programming only if building with an 
  expected value of the <span class="macro">NTDDI_VERSION</span> macro. The lowest 
  defined of these expected values was for Windows 2000. As appropriate as this 
  may have been for a kit that had Windows 2000 as its oldest supported target version 
  for building drivers, conditional blocks were added even for functions that long 
  pre-date Windows 2000. These functions’ declarations might just as well have been 
  left unadorned as far as could affect any programming. </p>
  <p>A second change in 2009 carried this notion of Windows 2000 as the beginning 
  of time into the documentation. The second WDK for Windows 7 (version 7600.16385.1, 
  dated 1st December 2009) added “Available in Windows 2000 and later versions of 
  Windows” to the documentation of nearly every function for which no minimum version 
  was yet specified. This is not unreasonable inasmuch as it means only that Microsoft 
  no longer supports earlier versions of Windows, but of course it will easily be 
  taken by some as accurate history. </p>
  <p>Of course, where Microsoft documents a function as available only in some versions, 
  the intention may just be that those are the versions for which the function is 
  implemented well enough for Microsoft to commit to its use by programmers in general. 
  It could be that the function is exported from earlier versions but in an experimental 
  or even defective implementation that Microsoft cannot support. Certainly, a pattern 
  is discernable in which a function is said to be available starting from whichever 
  Windows version was contemporaneous with the function’s introduction to the documentation. 
  This is perhaps how <span class="delayed function">RtlGetDaclSecurityDescriptor</span> 
  is dated to Windows Server 2003 SP1—yes, so precisely—even though it was by then 
  ten years old as an original export (not only from the kernel but NTDLL too).
