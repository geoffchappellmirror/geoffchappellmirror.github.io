<h1>W32THREADNONPAGED </h1>
<p>The <span class="struct">W32THREADNONPAGED</span> is a small structure that Windows 
10 introduced to sit between the <span class="struct">
<a href="../../ntoskrnl/structs/kthread/index.htm">KTHREAD</a></span> and
<span class="struct">W32THREAD</span> structures (the latter being a reduced
<span class="struct"><a href="threadinfo/index.htm">THREADINFO</a></span>). Where 
the <span class="member">Win32Thread</span> member of the <span class="struct">KTHREAD</span> 
used to point directly to the <span class="struct">W32THREAD</span>, it now points 
to the <span class="struct">W32THREADNONPAGED</span>. The <span class="struct">W32THREAD</span> 
itself is one pointer away, its address being held in the <span class="member">pW32Thread</span> 
member. Note that the <span class="member">Win32ThreadInfo</span> member of the
<span class="struct"><a href="../../../win32/ntdll/structs/teb.htm">TEB</a></span>, 
which is not just readable but writable in user mode, continues to hold the (kernel-mode) 
address of the <span class="struct">W32THREAD</span>. </p>
<p>As its name suggests, the <span class="struct">W32THREADNONPAGED</span> is allocated 
from non-paged (no-execute) pool. Less obviously, and in contrast to the
<span class="struct">W32THREAD</span>, the allocation is global, i.e., not per-session.
</p>
<table class="Struct">

<p>If only for now, what’s gained from the extra distance between the
<span class="struct">KTHREAD</span> and the <span class="struct">W32THREAD</span> 
is that WIN32K gets two new items of per-thread data that can be touched without 
fear of causing paging. These two support performance monitoring of WIN32K’s use 
of critical sections. For instance, asking to enter a critical section, as by the 
WIN32KBASE export <span class="function">EnterCrit</span>, loads
<span class="member">llQPCUserCritAcquire</span> with the current time (in units 
of the high-frequency performance counter) so that when the called function is about 
to return, having acquired the critical section, the time spent acquiring it can 
be traced. When the thread eventually asks to leave this critical section, the time 
spent holding it can be traced. The <span class="member">ullUserCritAcquireToken</span> 
records from a globally maintained sequence number of acquisitions. </p>
