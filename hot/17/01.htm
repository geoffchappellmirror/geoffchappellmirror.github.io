  <h1>Most Viewed in January 2017 </h1>
  <p>This site had 21,240 visits in January 2017, from <span class="highlight">15,003 
  unique visitors</span>. The list below is of pages that were each viewed at least 
  100 times in January 2017. </p>
  <p>The stand-out new performer is not what I’d most like to be known for. I don’t 
  look for security vulnerabilities, but when I document API functions I do of course 
  note what errors I’m aware of in the implementation. One such was immediately 
  obvious as letting even a low-integrity user-mode program crash Windows. Almost 
  as obvious was that the coding error has survived unchanged from even the oldest 
  Windows version that I ever received on MSDN discs (now over 20 years ago). I 
  reported it to the Microsoft Security Research Center at the end of December and 
  asked for guidance about how the error could be kept unpublished without compromising 
  my documentation of the relevant functionality. A few weeks later, wanting to 
  move on and not knowing when Microsoft’s timetable might prompt me to return to 
  the subject, I wrote up the details anyway. As I finished, having been ignored 
  for weeks, I published. Within two hours of my linking the published page from 
  any other in the site (so that it could be found), Microsoft asked for removal. 
  Apparently, Microsoft had only just that day got round to examining my report 
  and thus noticed the newly published details. Accept this as coincidence. The 
  point to so-called co-ordinated disclosure is not that it buys the vendor a few 
  weeks in which to do little or nothing. So, I left the page in plain view. Within 
  a day the page had hundreds of visits. So now I know that at least some handful 
  of people follow what I write, and then get the word around if what I write has 
  security implications. I don’t complain of the attention, and I even hope good 
  may come of it, yet it’s not an obvious fit with my vision of this site as an 
  information resource for Windows programming. There’s more than a little for me 
  to think from this. The business model for research into Windows as an aid to 
  Windows programming is tenuous. That it gets attention for the wrong reasons may 
  be a sign that it actually is wrong-headed of me to pursue it. </p>
  <p>Nothing else that’s truly new from the preceding year’s revival of research 
  and writing has yet made the cut. The page on Native API Functions, with 130 visits, 
  is new as its own page, but a lot of its text is nearly 10 years old. It was merely 
  assembled into this new page to explain to user-mode programmers why my documentation 
  of NTDLL exports whose names begin with Nt or Zw is in the Kernel section even 
  if the functions aren’t exported for kernel-mode use. Still, there are encouraging 
  signs that what documentation I have yet written of those functions is getting 
  read. </p>
  <p>Bubbling under this list, at 99 visits each, are two pages that genuinely are 
  new from last year. One is a practical
  <a href="../../studies/windows/km/ntoskrnl/api/ex/profile/demo.htm">Demonstration 
  of Self-Profiling</a>, in which a program gets to sample the execution of selected 
  routines in the program’s own code by using otherwise undocumented functions such 
  as <a href="../../studies/windows/km/ntoskrnl/api/ex/profile/create.htm">NtCreateProfile</a> 
  (only 64 visits, despite being vital to the crash described above). The other 
  is my documentation of the
  <a href="../../studies/windows/km/ntoskrnl/inc/api/ntexapi_x/kuser_shared_data/index.htm">
  KUSER_SHARED_DATA</a> structure. Microsoft has always semi-documented this structure, 
  in the sense of providing C-language definitions in header files, but from me 
  you get at least the beginnings of some curation, by which I mean not just commentary 
  on the members but also on their changes between versions. </p>
  <p>On a personal note, I find myself intrigued by the visits to two old, casually 
  written pages about bugs in Expression Web, as noticed in everyday use. Expression 
  Web is the editor I use for all pages at this site. To a large extent, I seem 
  to be stuck with it from my arguably naive decision to use Front Page when it 
  handily came with other Office programs all the way back in 1997. Front Page was 
  not without its occasional crash, but its development into Expression Web produced 
  what is easily the most bug-ridden commercial software I have ever used. What 
  always astonished me most, however, was not Microsoft’s lack of care but that 
  books and blogs were written about this software and described in some detail 
  this and that feature without ever hinting at the sort of ridiculous misbehaviour 
  that I saw as easily established just from an hour or two of casual observation. 
  Whenever I think of what’s wrong with the software industry, all that writing 
  about Expression Web reminds me that defects in software and the consequent abuses 
  of consumers are not just problems of manufacturing. We who write about software 
  have responsibilities too. </p>
