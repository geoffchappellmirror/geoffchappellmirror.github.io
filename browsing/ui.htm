  <h1>Interactive User Interface </h1>
  <p>This website is constructed around the premise that although each page may 
  know of other pages, and naturally will link to other pages, it
  <span class="emphasis">need</span> know only of itself and it doesn’t depend on 
  which other pages link to it. The place of a page within the site is not a property 
  of that page but of the site. The navigational support provided at this site is 
  therefore external to all the document pages. Being one of those computer users 
  who finds a directory tree entirely natural for depicting the storage of files, 
  I have chosen to present the navigational support as a table of contents (TOC) 
  that looks very much like a directory tree from a file system. </p>
  <p>If scripts on a document page run as expected, the page is rebuilt into a viewer. 
  There is an <a href="noviewer.htm">alternate user interface</a> for when those 
  scripts do not run, but I think the viewer is much better, not least for being 
  interactive. The viewer has a banner across the top and a table of contents at 
  the left. What remains is for the document page. </p>
  <p>As it happens, there are several TOCs. The site has several subwebs, which 
  are very nearly disjoint in the sense that few pages in one subweb link naturally 
  to any pages in any other subweb. Add that some of these subwebs run to several 
  hundred pages and it makes sense, if only to me, that each subweb has its own 
  TOC. </p>
  <h2>The Banner </h2>
  <p>You select a subweb by clicking on a tab at the bottom of the blue banner, 
  immediately above a horizontal grey divider. The intended suggestion is of tabs 
  on folders in a filing cabinet. The current subweb, i.e., the one that contains 
  the currently loaded document, is highlighted in that same grey. </p>
  <p>The banner also has a few links at the top right to pages that may be relevant 
  no matter which subweb you’re browsing. For instance, one button gives you a quick 
  way to find out how to reach me for <a href="../feedback/index.htm">Feedback</a>, 
  especially to tell me of corrections. Another is there in case you think to
  <a href="../consult/index.htm">Consult</a> me or otherwise sponsor the research 
  that underpins this website’s technical writing. </p>
  <p>Also in the banner is an indication of when the site last had my attention 
  in the form of an upload. To learn what has been uploaded, click on
  <a href="../new/index.htm">What’s New</a>. </p>
  <h2>The Table of Contents </h2>
  <p>Most entries in the TOC are links to document pages. Clicking on the link in 
  the left pane loads the corresponding document into the right pane. If the document 
  is in a different subweb, clicking will also replace the TOC in the left pane.
  </p>
  <p>The TOC is organised as a multi-level list which you can expand and collapse 
  according to what interests you while you browse the site. Note that multiple 
  branches can be open simultaneously, so that you may move easily between pages 
  without my having planned any particular connection between those pages. (I am 
  astonished at how many web-based TOCs permit only one branch to be expanded at 
  a time.) </p>
  <h3>Operation </h3>
  <p>To expand a collapsed folder or collapse an expanded one, simply click on the 
  icon immediately to the folder’s left. </p>
  <p>When you first expand a folder, it opens only one level deeper into the tree. 
  If you collapse a folder, any expansions that you had made deeper into the tree 
  are restored if you re-expand that folder. </p>
  <h4>Recursion </h4>
  <p>To expand a folder and all its subfolders, even if any are already expanded, 
  hold down the Ctrl key for the click. To collapse a folder and all its subfolders, 
  hold down both the Ctrl and Shift keys while clicking. </p>
  <p>Recursively collapsing a collapsed folder has no immediate visual effect, but 
  is useful as a reset: it clears any expansions that had been made deeper into 
  the tree. A re-expansion will then open only one level, as if the folder had never 
  yet been expanded. </p>
  <h3>Synchronisation </h3>
  <p>The TOC item that represents the currently loaded document page is always indicated 
  (as white text against dark blue). There should never be any occasion to want 
  to resynchronise the document page with the table of contents. If there is, and 
  it isn’t resolved by refreshing the page, it is a bug. Please try to identify 
  steps for reproduction, and then
  <a href="mailto:feedback@geoffchappell.com?subject=TOC%20Synchronisation%20Bug?">
  write to me</a> about it. (Or just wait a few days, since sometimes it happens 
  that I upload a new document but forget the new TOC that knows of this document.)
  </p>
  <p>If you click on a link in a document page and this link takes you to another 
  page at this site, then the target page becomes the current link in the TOC and 
  its subweb is highlighted in the banner. If the source and target are in the same 
  subweb, then whatever expanding and collapsing you have done in that subweb’s 
  TOC is preserved—yes, without leaving cookies on your computer. If the source 
  and target are in different subwebs, then the state of the source subweb’s TOC 
  is lost. If this matters, then opt instead to follow the link to a New Tab.
  </p>
  <h3>Keyboard Shortcuts </h3>
  <p>When the TOC has the keyboard focus, the usual Internet Explorer keyboard shortcuts 
  of Tab and Shift-Tab work to move the focus down the table and back up (respectively), 
  from one link to another, but only among those links that you have exposed by 
  your expanding and collapsing of folders. </p>
  <p>Sadly, most of the long-established keyboard shortcuts for moving around multi-panel 
  Windows programs have fallen into disuse: yes, even as software manufacturers 
  and commentators on user-interface design talk more and more about the importance 
  of keyboard interfaces for accessibility. Getting the focus to the TOC can be 
  quite a bother! </p>
  <p>Even Tab and Shift-Tab do not have universal support. More than a decade ago, 
  I noted here that some other browsers treat Tab and Shift-Tab much as does Internet 
  Explorer but that some, namely Opera and Safari, seem not to. I know of nothing 
  I can sensibly do about this. Just as I think it’s not a browser’s business to 
  interfere with long-established Windows functionality, neither could I consider 
  my website well-behaved if it interferes with the browsers. </p>
  <h4>Expanding and Collapsing Folders </h4>
  <p>To expand or collapse a folder with the keyboard, get the focus to that folder 
  and then press one of the following keys from the numeric keypad: </p>
  <table>
    <tr>
      <th>Key </th>
      <th>Action </th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>+ (plus) </td>
      <td>expand the folder </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>- (minus) </td>
      <td>collapse the folder </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>* (multiply) </td>
      <td>expand the folder and all its subfolders </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>/ (divide) </td>
      <td>collapse the folder and all its subfolders </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  <p>These key assignments may be familiar, with slight variation, as those of the 
  folder tree in the Windows Explorer and more generally of the tree-view control. 
  A difference from tree views in such programs as the Windows Explorer is that 
  arrow keys do not act either to move the focus or to expand or collapse folders: 
  Internet Explorer has the arrow keys act on the scrollbars instead and I have 
  chosen to work with that rather than to change it. </p>
  <p>The minus and divide keys also act on list items that are not folders. They 
  then collapse the enclosing folder, without your having had to move the focus 
  to it. </p>
  <p>These keyboard shortcuts also work in most browsers. I do not plan to modify 
  this interface to suit other browsers. I may yet do something for the ever more 
  frequently encountered keyboards that do not have a numeric keypad. </p>
  <h3>TOC Resizing </h3>
  <p>The user interface for resizing the TOC is in flux. When the viewer was a FRAMESET, 
  the browser provided natively for resizing the divider between the TOC and document 
  panels. WIth the change in 2021 to a set of DIV and IFRAME elements, similar resizing 
  can be obtained from new browsers but otherwise requires support from scripts.
  </p>
  <p>If only for now, the scripts provide for just two interactions with the divider. 
  First, the divider can simply be dragged to wherever you want it. The scripts 
  will carry your choice from page to page. This is of course just the minimum necessary 
  functionality. It is well settled, but may yet be tweaked for whether the width 
  that carries from page to page is measured in pixels or as a percentage. </p>
  <p>The other interactivity is that you can click on the divider or, presumably, 
  tap on it. This developed from thinking ahead to what might be done for readers 
  who try browsing the site with mobile phones or (more plausibly) tablets but anyway 
  with narrow viewports. It is now settled that clicking on the divider will send 
  it to the far left, thus hiding the TOC and maximising the space available for 
  the document. Clicking the divider when it is at the far left will restore it 
  to wherever it had been, thus retrieving the TOC for navigation. </p>
  <h2>Small Screens </h2>
  <p>If the viewport is narrow enough, the TOC is initially hidden whenever a document 
  loads. The only hint of its existence is the grey border at the left. It perhaps 
  does not stand out as interactive. Yet at 8 pixels, it is hardly insubstantial: 
  for some mobile phones, it’s more than 2% of the screen width! Hovering over it 
  will reveal a tool tip. Clicking on it will “restore” the TOC to the full width. 
  The divider then shows as the same grey border but on the right. Click on it to 
  hide the TOC again and recover the document. Click on a link while the TOC is 
  spread across your screen, and when the new page loads, the TOC will automatically 
  be hidden again. I don’t expect to improve on this any time soon, if ever. </p>
